// This devcontainer.json is as minimal as possible to mimick the CI environment.
// In this way, it is easier to develop for the CI. To achieve this, the devcontainer
// uses the image directly, and only copies the grammar from cache to bootstrap a similar
// environment as CI, since entrypoint.sh is not run on creation.
