// This devcontainer.json is as minimal as possible to mimick the CI environment.
// In this way, it is easier to develop for the CI. To achieve this, the devcontainer
// uses the image directly, and only copies the grammar from cache to bootstrap a similar
// environment as CI, since entrypoint.sh is not run on creation.

// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/universal
