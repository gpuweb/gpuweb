# Homework for meetings

Discussions we have in the WebGPU meetings usually require a lot of context to be productive.
This is both because we need to know how all 3 native APIs work and because we try to find the right tradeoffs given many constraints.
Having members of the group produce investigations and proposals is the best way to share context to the group, but it needs to arrive in a timely manner to be useful.
It happened that multi-page investigations were posted 5 minutes before the start of the meeting in which they were to be discussed.
This obviously makes it impossible for other members to catch up and explaining the investigation step-by-step in the meeting is a waste of people's valuable time.
The reverse situation happened too were investigations were posted days (or weeks) in advance but members didn't take/have the time to read them in time, resulting in the same waste of time.

This proposal tries to codify what the expectations are on the members to make meetings happen smoothly.

## Producer homework

In order for members to have time to review material for a meeting, the meat of investigations and proposals have to be posted at least 48 working day hours in advance.
For example for a meeting on Monday at 3PM, material has to be posted before the previous Thursday at 3PM.
Topics for which the material isn't ready by that deadline can be dropped from the meeting to leave space for topics with more shared knowledge.
Small-scale clarifications and discussions on the material don't have a deadline themselves though.

To be determined is how these materials are advertised so people know what to read.

## Consumer homework

Members should become familiar with the material for the meeting in these 48 hours (or even before that).
Ideally they should ask for simple clarifications in advance too.
