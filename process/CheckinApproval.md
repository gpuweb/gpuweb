A proposed change that is either considered to be noncontroversial or has already been agreed upon by the group should begin as a pull request to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb Where it will require approval from an editor. If the pull request is initiated by an editor, another will still have to review it. That is not to say that other feedback on pull requests is unwelcome. Discussions can play out over these as they have previously.

If the reviewer agrees that the pull request is uncontroversial or matches what has already been agreed upon, an editor can approve and merge it. To make sure this is conducted properly, interested parties are invited to *watch* the gpuweb repository and monitor the changes there. If something is approved as uncontroversial or resolved seems incorrect, the issue can be brought up and discussed with the larger group if needed. If necessary, merged changes can be reverted or altered if its determined they were in error.
