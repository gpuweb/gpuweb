# WebGPU Extension Proposals

The documents in this directory are
[WebGPU extension documents](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#extension-documents)
which describe **non-normative, non-standardized draft proposals** to add functionality to WebGPU.

These proposals **may or may not be under active consideration**.
Check the "roadmap" of an extension document to understand its status.

These proposals are **not stable** and may change at any time. They may be:

- In-development proposals which are not easily contained in a GitHub pull request, HackMD, or similar.
- Inactive proposals which are not under active consideration but could be considered later.

If the group agrees that it never intends to consider a proposal in the future, it should be
removed from this directory (and may be migrated outside of the WebGPU community group).

## New Proposals

Copy the format of an existing proposal. Proposals may be informal, as they are never normative.
However, be sure to include a **detailed roadmap** to set expectations for developers, and, as
appropriate, include:

- WebGPU spec changes (including feature flags)
- WGSL spec changes (including enable directives)
- Links to context (like corresponding Vulkan/D3D12/Metal features) and past discussions
