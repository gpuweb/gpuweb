# Bindless

**Roadmap: This proposal is under active development, but has not been standardized for inclusion in the WebGPU specification.
The proposal is likely to change before it is standardized.**
WebGPU implementations must not expose this functionality; doing so is a spec violation.
Note however, an implementation might provide an option (e.g. command line flag) to enable a draft implementation, for developers who want to test this proposal.

## Motivation

In the current (non-bindless) WebGPU binding model, shaders have access to a small set of resources that are in the `GPUBindGroups` currently bound at the time `draw*` or `dispatch*` is called.
The CPU-side code of the application has to know the what are all resources a shader might need and bind it at command-recording time.
The amount of resources bound while executing a shader also has to stay under limits that can be fairly low.

This model was chosen for the first version of WebGPU as WebGPU without extension needs to run on a variety of hardware, including hardware that has a fixed number of "registers" configured to access resources.
In this "bindful" model, `setBindGroup` sets the internal state of the registers, and shader assembly uses a register number to name a resource.
Over the last decades, GPU architectures have shifted to a "bindless" model where resources are instead named in shaders assembly by a GPU memory pointer, or an index into a table somewhere in memory.
This let shaders index a vastly increased amount of resources and allowed many new kinds of GPU algorithms.

In more recent rendering engines many algorithms execute on the GPU that need global information about the scene or the objects contained in it.
They need access to each texture potentially used by an object in case they need to process that object.
This blows way past the resource limits in the bindful model.
Examples of algorithms that do this are:

 - Visibility buffers, which do a first rasterization pass with just object and triangle IDs in a render target, then  have a compute shader / large quad that handles the texturing of all objects at once.
 - Ray-tracing where rays can be launched in any direction and need to get the texture of the intersected object.
 - Rendering 2D contents with many embedded images.
 - And a lot, lot more.

In some cases texture atlasing can be used as a (painful) workaround, but it can become extremely messy, inefficient (with lots of the atlas unused), or inflexible.
Exposing the bindless capabilities of the hardware would enhance the programming model of WebGPU and unlock many exciting new applications and capabilities.

## Investigation

### Bindless concepts

**Residency**: Residency management where the driver makes sure all used resources are swapped-in to GPU memory can no longer be done totally automatically; it needs information from the application.
When the GPU runs out of memory to keep all allocations of all resources in GPU memory at the same time, the driver can swap them in and out of system (CPU) memory to keep the necessary working set available in GPU memory when shaders execute.
In the bindful model, the driver has close to perfect information of which resources will be used and does that automatically.
In bindless, applications can use any resource at any time so applications must manage residency by telling the driver which resources must be kept resident when.
The WebGPU implementation must still be resilient to misbehaving pages that try to oversubscribe resources.

**Indexing of descriptors - uninitialized entries**: In all APIs bindless is be done by indexing descriptors (Metal can a bit more flexible) in arrays of descriptors that have been allocated by the application.
Applications allocate conservatively-sized arrays and elements might not be initialized, or contain stale data (esp past the currently used index range).
Sparse arrays are supported in target APIs, as long as the uninitialized entries are not used. 

**Indexing of descriptors - index uniformity**: Some hardware can only index inside the descriptor arrays uniformly, though a scalarization loops allows emulating non-uniform indexing.

**Descriptor homogeneity**: Hardware descriptors may have different sizes depending on the resource type.
For example a buffer could be a 64bit virtual address, while a sampled texture could be a 64 byte data payload.
This makes allocation of the descriptor arrays and their indexing in the shader depend on the type of descriptor, so descriptor types may not always be mixed in the same descriptor array. 

**Samplers**: Samplers stayed "bindful" a lot longer than other types of resources because they are pure fixed-function object that don't have contents.
In all APIs bindless for samplers has additional constraints and limits. 

### D3D12 / HLSL

Overall D3D12 was designed with bindless at the forefront with the descriptor tables, although support depends on the hardware tier.
CBV UAV SRV descriptor heaps are heterogeneous on the API side but HLSL only gained support with `ResourceHeaps` in Shader Model 6.6.

#### D3D12

D3D12's binding model is centered around the [root signature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/root-signatures-overview) and [descriptor heaps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/creating-descriptor-heaps)

Resource in D3D12 are bound in the root signature (equivalent of the `GPUPipelineLayout`) that can contain root constants (immediate data), root descriptors (a single binding) or a root descriptor table (an array of bindings).
The root descriptor table [is defined with `set*RootDescriptorTable`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-setgraphicsrootdescriptortable) as the `D3D12_GPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE` (GPU memory pointer) to the first element of the array.
This handle must be inside one of the two currently bound descriptor heaps (the one for sampler, or the one for everything else).

Descriptors heaps are either CPU heaps used for staging, or GPU heaps that are actually used by the hardware and usable in root signature.
D3D12 supports [copies between heaps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-copydescriptors) to move from staging to shader-visible heaps.
Shader-visible heaps and root descriptor tables have limits that depend on the [resource binding tier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/hardware-support).
Tier 2 is bindless for textures, Tier 3 bindless for everything. Both tiers have a limit of 2048 max descriptors in sampler heaps but [recent D3D12 features](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/VulkanOn12.html#sampler-descriptor-heap-size-increase) add a queriable maximum of at least 4000.

D3D12 delegates [residency management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/residency) to the application that tags individual memory heaps (allocations from which resources are sub-allocated) resident and evicts them.

CBV_UAV_SRV descriptor heaps in D3D12 are heterogenous with a device-wide [increment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-getdescriptorhandleincrementsize) between descriptors when copying between heaps or indexing them.

It is not allowed to change a descriptor in a heap while it might be in use by commands as that could be a data-race.

#### HLSL

On the HLSL side, using bindless is done by declaring unsized arrays of textures, and specifying it is unbounded in the root signature (if one is provided in the HLSL):

```
// Declaration
Texture2D<float4> textures[] : register(t0)

// Root signature
DescriptorTable( CBV(b1), UAV(u0, numDescriptors = 4), SRV(t0, numDescriptors=unbounded) )
```

Non-uniform indexing must be done with an extra `NonUniformResourceIndex` keyword:

```
tex1[NonUniformResourceIndex(myMaterialID)].Sample(samp[NonUniformResourceIndex(samplerID)], texCoords);
```

The restriction here is that a single type is given for the array so it is not possible to chose dynamically inside the shader what the type of the binding will be.
It has to be statically known to be UAV, SRV or CBV, and even then it must be a single type for each of there (a float, uint, or int texture).
Overlapping of the root descriptor range in the same root descriptor table is allowed which could be used to have different types in HLSL.

Shader Model 6.6 lifts this restriction with the [dynamic resources](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/HLSL_SM_6_6_DynamicResources.html) feature. The `ResourceDescriptorHeap` HLSL object can be used to cast any index to any resource type:

```
<resource variable> = ResourceDescriptorHeap[uint index];
<sampler variable> = SamplerDescriptorHeap[uint index];
```

### Metal / MSL

Metal [argument buffer tier 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/buffers/improving_cpu_performance_by_using_argument_buffers?language=objc) supports dynamically indexing resources in arbitrarily-sized argument buffers.
[After specific-OS releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/buffers/improving_cpu_performance_by_using_argument_buffers?language=objc) it seems that the argument buffer layout is transparent and could be used for heterogeneous descriptor but there is no indication how.

#### Metal

Argument buffers are `MTLBuffers` that contain resources usable by the shader.
Their layout is opaque (maybe until macOS 13.0 for Tier2 devices?) and they have to be filled by using an `MTLArgumentEncoder` which is similar to a `GPUBindGroupLayout` either reflected from an `MTLLibrary` or created directly with `MTLArgumentDescriptor`.
It is called out explicily that argument buffers cannot contain unions, so that can't be used for heterogeneous descriptors.
The argument buffers are bound with the `set*Buffer` method like any other buffer.
With argument buffer tier 2 it is also possible to directly write `buffer.gpuAddress` somwhere in `argumentBuffer.contents`.

When using argument buffers, the application must handle residency explicitly by calling `useResource`, `useHeap` (when suballocating resources), or `useResidencySet`.

Samplers used with argument buffers must have supportsArgumentBuffer set to true, and MTLDevices have a query for the maximum number of unique such samplers that are supported.

#### MSL

Here is an example from the Metal documentation.
The argument to the entrypoint is a reference to a structure containing resources itself.
The layout of this struct must correspond to the `MTLArgumentEncoder`:

```
struct ArgumentBufferExample{
    texture2d<float, access::write> a;
    depth2d<float> b;
    sampler c;
    texture2d<float> d;
    device float4* e;
    texture2d<float> f;
    int g;
};


kernel void example(constant ArgumentBufferExample & argumentBuffer [[buffer(0)]])
{
```

Metal Shading Language Specification 3.2 section 2.14.1 "The Need for a Uniform Type" shows that Metal will scalarize non-uniform indexing in arrays of resources, but at a cost.

It's not immediately clear how heterogeneous bindless would be expressed in MSL.

### Vulkan / SPIR-V

Vulkan promoted [`VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing.html) ([documentation](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/descriptor_indexing/README.html)) to core in Vulkan 1.2, it is how bindless is exposed in that API.
Further extensions enable additional niceness, like [`VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type.html).

#### Vulkan

Applications start by querying [`VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Features`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-khr-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures).`dynamicIndexing` then can get more information from [`VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-khr-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures) like whether updating descriptors sets in use is possible, if sparse descriptor sets are possible, and if SPIR-V can use the `RuntimeDescriptorArray` capability.

When creating a `VkDescriptorSet` new flags can be passed to the last binding to specify the set my be sparse, may be updated after being bound / while in use, and maybe have a variable length array as the last element.
When allocating a descriptor set for this layout, [`VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountAllocateInfo`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-khr-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlagBits) is passed to specify how big this variable size array at the end will be.

Descriptor sets can only be modified on the device timeline and descriptors cannot be modified while they might be in use as that would be a race.
`VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer` is another related extension which could allow pipelining the updates to descriptors with other queue operations.

By default in Vulkan, all resources are resident at all time and the application must manage residency by itself.
Some Vulkan extensions like [`VK_EXT_memory_budget`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_EXT_memory_budget.html) and [`VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory.html) allow getting a memory budget and asking the driver to manage residency but are far from available on all systems.

#### SPIR-V

The bindings instead of being pointers to `OpTypeImage` or `OpTypeArray<OpTypeImage, N>` can be `OpTypeRuntimeArray<OpTypeImage>` which allows for unbounded indexing.

When using mutable descriptor types for heterogeneous descriptors, [multiple bindings can be aliased on the same set/binding location](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/SPIR-V.rst#resourcedescriptorheaps-samplerdescriptorheaps), one for each type of descriptor accessed in the shader.

### Constraints from WebGPU implementations

In the target APIs, a call to `setBindGroup` results in a underlying API command that bakes a GPU pointer (or index in heap) in the native command buffer.
The APIs don't support patching these GPU pointers / indices before submitting commands to the GPU.
This means that **`GPUBindGroups` set in an encoder cannot have their underlying API object replaced before submit.**

Other constraints from (some) underlying APIs are that bindings can only be updated on the device timeline, and that updates must not race with potential uses of these bindings by the GPU.
Thi means that **Bindings cannot be overwritten before `onSubmittedWorkDone` since the last time they were visible on the queue timeline**.

## Proposal

### WebGPU API

#### Adapter capabilities and device creation

Two new optional features are added:

 - `"dynamic-binding-array"` that exposes dynamic binding arrays (basically bindless `GPUBindGroups`) containing a single type of resource.
 - `"heterogeneous-dynamic-binding-array"` that depends on it, that additionally allows dynamic binding arrays with any kind of bindless resource.

There are two separate extensions because while the heterogeneous bindless is what we want to expose in the future, requiring support for it would prevent exposing bindless on a lot of devices that support the homogeneous version.

```webidl
partial enum GPUFeatureName {
    "dynamic-binding-array",
    "heterogeneous-dynamic-binding-array",
};
```

Dynamic binding arrays are sized by the developer with a value passed in `createBindGroup` so a new limit is needed to expose the underlying API limitations on the size of the bindless things.
D3D12 has fixed limits per "resource binding tier" (with 500 000 being the base one) while Vulkan has limits per binding type that would be better to have as a single minimum limit (at least 500 000 in practice).
The new `maxDynamicBindingArraySize` limit is added, of class "maximum" and minimum of 500000 when either optional feature is available.

```webidl
partial dictionay GPUSupportedLimits {
    readonly attribute unsigned long maxDynamicBindingArraySize;
};
```

#### Bindgroup and layout creation

Dynamic binding arrays are added to `GPUBindGroups` as a second, variable-size, sparse and (totally or partially) heterogeneous range of bindings positioned after the regular WebGPU bindings.
The `GPUBindGroupLayoutDescriptor` gains a `GPUDynamicBindingArrayLayout` member that describes where the range of bindings for the dynamic binding array starts, and what it may contain.
Likewise `GPUBindGroupDescriptor` gains a `dynamicArraySize` that describes the actual size of the dynamic binding array.
Because `GPUBindGroup` become objects with variable-sized contents, they get a new `destroy()` method to free the GPU memory without waiting on the GC.

```webidl
enum GPUDynamicBindingType {
    "sampled-texture",
    "storage-texture",
    "storage-buffer",
    "texel-buffer",
    "sampler",
};

dictionary GPUDynamicBindingArrayLayout {
    unsigned long start = 0;
    GPUDynamicBindingType type;
};

partial dictionary GPUBindGroupLayoutDescriptor {
    GPUDynamicBindingArrayLayout dynamicArray;
};

partial dictionay GPUBindGroupDescriptor {
    unsigned long dynamicArraySize;
};

partial interface GPUBindGroup {
    void destroy();
};
```

`GPUDynamicBindingArrayLayout.type` chooses what kind of resources the dynamic binding array my contain.
When `heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array` is enabled, it may be set to `undefined` in which case the dynamic binding array may contain any binding compatible with an other value of `GPUDynamicBindingType`.
The size of the dynamic binding array is not known when creating the layout, so it uses all the bindings in `[GPUDynamicBindingArrayLayout.start, Infinity)`.
The use of a dynamic binding array implicitly uses a storage buffer binding for all stages for the `GPUBindGroupLayout` (this is required for the implementation of the validation of bindless).

Validation rules added to `GPUDevice.createBindGroupLayout(desc)` when `desc.dynamicArray` is specified:

 - `"dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device (explicitly or implicitly with `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"`).
 - `desc.dynamicArray.start` must be less than `maxBindingsPerBindGroup`.
 - If `desc.dynamicArray.desc.type` is `undefined`, `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device.
 - Each `entry` in `desc.entries` must have `entry.binding` (+ the array size) less than `desc.dynamicArray.start`.

Validation rules added to `GPUDevice.createBindGroup(desc)`:

 - `desc.dynamicArraySize` must be defined IFF `desc.layout.[[desc]].dynamicArray` is defined.
 - if `desc.dynamicArraySize` is defined:

    - `"dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device (explicitly or implicitly with `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"`).
    - `desc.dynamicArraySize` must be less than or equal to the device's `maxDynamicBindingArraySize`.
    - Each `entry` in `desc.entries` that doesn't match an entry in `desc.layout.[[desc]].entries` must have `entry.binding - desc.layout.[[desc]].dynamicArray.start` in `[0, desc.dynamicArraySize)`.
    - Each `entry` in `desc.entries` in the dynamic array range must be compatible with `desc.layout.[[desc]].dynamicArray.type`. (TODO [#5374](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/5374), determine the compatibility rules).


The vast majority of `GPUBindGroups` will not contain a dynamic binding array, so to minimize the additional `queue.submit` validation overhead, only the dynamic binding array `GPUBindGroups` may be destroyed.
Hence here are the validation rules for `GPUBindGroup.destroy()`:

 - `"dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device (explicitly or implicitly with `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"`).
 - `this.[[desc]].dynamicArraySize` must be defined.

Additional validation rule for `queue.submit()`:

 - All `GPUBindGroups` with a dynamic binding array must not have had `.destroy()` called on them.

#### Pinning of buffer and texture usages

Experience from wgpu-rs' prototyping of bindless is that the overhead of validating the state of resources and generating memory barriers for the dynamic binding arrays is unacceptable.
There is the need to make the resources in the dynamic binding array be "free" for validation and memory barrier generation, instead of walking them for each usage synchronization scope.
This proposal introduces "resource pinning" to a specific kind of usage.
When a resource is unpinned it can be used with any usages specified at creation, but when pinned only the single pinned usage is allowed.
This proposal contains WGSL-side validation for the accesses which is augmented to also check that resources are pinned in addition to being present and of the correct type.
This way unpinned resources are not accessible via dynamic arrays, ensuring that correct validation and barriers are done when resources are pinned.

```webidl
partial interface GPUTexture {
    void pin(GPUTextureUsage usage);
    void unpin();
};
```

TODO: [#5375](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/5375) Add the similar interface for `GPUBuffer`.

TODO: [#5376](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/5376) Ahould usages be used when they don't differentiate between read-only storage access and writeable storage access?

TODO: [#5378](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/5378) Pinning and unpinning add additional state to resources that makes WebGPU code less composable, are there better alternatives?

TODO: [#5381](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/5381) Add a mechanism to allow unpinning locally for some sets of commands (like rendering to one of the textures in the dynamic binding array).

Validation for `GPUTexture.pin(usage)`:

 - `"dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device (explicitly or implicitly with `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"`).
 - `this` must not have been destroyed.
 - `usage` must be a single shader usage.

Validation for `GPUTexture.unpin()`:

 - `"dynamic-binding-array"` must be enabled on the device (explicitly or implicitly with `"heterogenous-dynamic-binding-array"`).

Note that the calls to `pin` and `unpin` don't need to be balanced. Pinning replaces the currently pinned usage, if any.

Every check for `GPUTexture.[[destroyed]]` for use with `usage` of the texture by the GPU has an additional check that the pinned usage, if any, matches `usage`.
In implementations this can be done with almost no additional overhead to the current validation of `[[destroyed]]` by replacing sets of used resources into maps of resources to usages, and by combining the `usage` and `[[destroyed]]` checks in a single bitmask check.
