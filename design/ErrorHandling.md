# Error Handling

The simplest design for error handling would be to do it synchronously, for example with Javascript exceptions and object creation returning `null`.
However, this would introduce a lot of synchronization points for multi-threaded/multi-process WebGPU implementations, making it too slow to be useful.

There are a number of cases that developers or applications need error handling for:

 - *Debugging*: Getting errors synchronously during development, to break in to the debugger.
 - *Telemetry*: Collecting error logs in deployment, for bug reporting and telemetry.
 - *Fallible Allocation*: Recovering from recoverable errors (like out-of-memory on resource creation).
 - *Fallback*: Tearing down the application and falling back, e.g. to WebGL, 2D Canvas, or static content.

Meanwhile, error handling should not make the API clunky to use.

There are several types of WebGPU calls that get their errors handled differently:

 - *Creation*: WebGPU Object creation.
 - *Encoding*: Recording of GPU commands in `GPUCommandEncoder`.
 - *Operations*: Other API calls, such as `GPUQueue.submit`.

## *Debugging*: Dev Tools

Implementations should provide a way to enable synchronous validation, for example via a debug shim or via the developer tools.
The extra overhead needs to be low enough that applications can still run while being debugged.

## *Telemetry* \& *Fallback*: Error Logging

`GPUDevice` keeps a log of errors that happened on each thread (main thread or Web Worker).
The application "eventually" recieves these errors, asynchronously via a callback.

These errors are all delivered through one stream - not directly associated with the objects or operations that produced them.
They should not be used by applications to recover from expected, recoverable errors.
Instead, the error log may be used for handling unexpected errors in deployment, for bug reporting and telemetry.

```
enum GPULogEntryType {
    "device-lost",
    "validation-error",
    "recoverable-out-of-memory",
};

interface GPULogEntry {
    readonly attribute GPULogEntryType type;
    readonly attribute any object;
    readonly attribute DOMString? reason;
};

callback GPULogCallback = void (GPULogEntry error);

partial interface GPUDevice {
    attribute GPULogCallback onLog;
};
```

`GPUObjectStatusType` makes a distinction between several error types:

 - `"validation-error"`: validation of some WebGPU call failed - including if an argument was an "invalid object".
   (Either the application did something wrong, or it chose not to recover from a recoverable error.)
 - `"device-lost"`: the `GPUDevice` cannot be used anymore.
   This may happen if the device is destroyed by the application, reclaimed by the browser, or something goes terribly wrong.
 Â  (An application may request a new device, or choose to fallback to other content.)
 - `"out-of-memory"`: an allocation failed because too much memory was used by the application (CPU or GPU).
   This includes recoverable out of memory errors that aren't opt-ed in to be handled by the application when the resource was created.

For creation errors, the `object` attribute holds the object handle that was created.
(It will point to an "invalid" object.)
It preserves the JavaScript object wrapper of that handle (including any extra JavaScript properties attached to that wrapper).

The `reason` is human-readable text, provided for debugging/reporting/telemetry.

When an error is reported by the WebGPU implementation, the `onLog` attribute, if set, receives this error (asynchronously).
`onLog` is called once per error log entry.
(If `onLog` is set or changed after some operation which logs an error, that error may or may not be sent to the new `onLog` handler.)

`onLog` may be called with a `"context-lost"`.
If a `"context-lost"` error is logged, no other errors will be subsequently logged.

The WebGPU implementation may choose to not log an error if too many errors, or too many errors of the same kind, have been logged.

## Object Creation

WebGPU objects are opaque handles.
On creation, such a handle is "pending" until the backing object is created by the implementation.
After that, a handle may refer to a successfully created object (called a "valid object"), or an error that occured during creation (called an "invalid object").

When a WebGPU object handle is passed to an operation, the object will resolve (to "valid" or "invalid") before it is actually used by that operation.

### Error propagation of invalid objects

Using any invalid object in a WebGPU operation produces a validation error.
The effect of an error depends on the type of a call:

 - For object creation, the call produces a new invalid object.
 - For `GPUCommandEncoder` encoding methods, the `GPUCommandEncoder.finishEncoding` method will return an invalid object.
 - For other WebGPU calls, the call becomes a no-op.

In each case, an error is logged to the error log.

## *Fallible Allocation*: Out-of-memory in object creation

Recoverable fallible allocations are exposed as Promise versions of the `createBuffer`/`createTexture` entry points.

```webidl
partial interface GPUDevice {
    Promise<GPUBuffer?> tryCreateBuffer(GPUBufferDescriptor descriptor);
    Promise<GPUTexture?> tryCreateTexture(GPUTextureDescriptor descriptor);
};
```

If an application wants to allocate with fatal out-of-memory, it uses `createBuffer`/`createTexture`.
Just like with any the creation of smaller objects, an out-of-memory condition will be treated as a fatal error: the device is lost.

The `tryCreate*` entry points return Promises.
 - If resource allocation succeeds, the Promise resolves to a *valid* object.
   (Though device loss can still make the object invalid at any time.)
 - If resource allocation runs out of memory, the Promise resolves to `null`.
 - If there is a validation error, the Promise resolves to an invalid object (and produces a log entry).
    - If the device is lost, the Promise resolves to an invalid object.
(The Promise never rejects, as the application should not need to further handle those cases.)

### Relation to `createReady*Pipeline`

`createReady*Pipeline` should be symmetrical with `tryCreate*`, so it is also described here.

While not error-handling related, the `createReady*Pipeline` entry points also return Promises.
 - If creation succeeds, the Promise resolves to a *valid* object.
   (Though device loss can still make the object invalid at any time.)
 - If there is a validation error, the Promise resolves to an invalid object (and produces a log entry).
    - If the device is lost, the Promise resolves to an invalid object.
(The Promise never rejects, as the application should not need to further handle those cases.)

## Open Questions and Considerations

 - WebGPU could guarantee that objects such as `GPUQueue` and `GPUFence` can never be errors.
   If this is true, then the only synchronous API that needs special casing is buffer mapping, where `mapping` is always `null` for an invalid `GPUBuffer`.

 - Should developers be able to self-impose a memory limit (in order to emulate lower-memory devices)?
   Should implementations automatically impose a lower memory limit (to improve portability)?

 - To help developers, `GPULogEntry.reason` could contain some sort of "stack trace" and could take advantage of debug name of objects if that's something that's present in WebGPU.
   For example:

   ```
   Failed <myQueue>.submit because commands[0] (<mainColorPass>) is invalid:
   - <mainColorPass> is invalid because in setIndexBuffer, indexBuffer (<mesh3.indexBuffer>) is invalid
   - <mesh3.indexBuffer> is invalid because it got an unsupported usage flag (0x89)
   ```

 - How do applications handle the case where they've allocated a lot of optional memory, but want to make another required allocation (which could fail due to OOM)?
   How do they know when to free an optional allocation first?
    - For now, applications wanting to handle this kind of case must always use fallible allocations.
    - (We will likely improve this with a `GPUResourceHeap`, once we figure out what that looks like.)

## Resolved Questions
   
 - Should there be a mode/flag which causes OOM errors to trigger context loss?
    - Resolved: Not necessary, since an application can manually destroy the context based on entries in the error log.

 - In a world with persistent object "usage" state:
   If an invalid command buffer is submitted, and its transitions becomes no-ops, the usage state won't update.
   Will this cause future command buffer submits to become invalid because of a usage validation error?
    - Tentatively resolved: WebGPU is expected not to require explicit usage transitions.

 - Should an object creation error immediately log an error to the error log?
   Or should it only log if the error propagates to a device-level operation?
    - Tentatively resolved: errors should be logged immediately.

 - Should applications be able to intentionally create graphs of potentially-invalid objects, and recover from this late?
   E.g. create a large buffer, create a bind group from that, create a command buffer from that, then choose whether to submit based on whether the buffer was successfully allocated.
    - If yes, `tryCreateBuffer` must return `GPUBuffer` and error log entries must not be generated when creating objects from invalid objects.
      (Only log errors on queue.submit and other device/queue level operations.)
    - If no, `tryCreateBuffer` should return `Promise<GPUBuffer?>` and error log entries should be generated when creating objects from invalid objects.
    - Tentatively resolved: no.

 - Should there be an API to query object status?
    - Tentatively resolved: no. (API was removed in #197.)
       - This query was only useful for detecting createPipeline completion and createBuffer/Texture OOM (now both done via Promise).
       - Validation errors should not be detected, because they indicate programming errors (hopefully), so they are surfaced through the error log instead.
       - Device loss applies to all objects on a device, and is handled through a separate mechanism, so it's not useful to separately know that an individual object on the device is invalid.

 - Should `tryCreate*` (and `createReady*Pipeline`) resolve to invalid objects on validation failure and device loss, instead of rejecting?
   This simplifies things slightly by avoiding giving useless extra info to the app via "reject" (which they would ignore/noop anyway).
   Instead these Promises would never reject.
    - Tentatively resolved: yes.
