# FAQ: WebGPU direction on shader language

## What is the shader language for WebGPU?

WebGPU will use a new shader language "WebGPU Shader Language",
or "WGSL" for short.

WGSL is designed for use with WebGPU, and the two are being
designed together.
Offshoots of WGSL may appear over time, but that is beyond the
scope of WebGPU and the W3C WebGPU Community Group.

WGSL is under development, but will have the following traits:

*   It is a text-based language.
*   It is suitable for humans to read and write.
*   It is strongly typed.
*   It directly represents block-structured programming, including
    sequence, selection (if/else), and repetition (looping).
*   It can be faithfully and simply converted to and from SPIR-V
    “Shader” modules that only use GPU features available in WebGPU.
*   With reasonable effort, it can be faithfully converted to other
    shading languages such as HLSL and Metal Shading Language.

The W3C WebGPU community group agreed to this direction during the
February 2020 face-to-face meeting in Redmond.


## How do you pronounce "WGSL"?

The W3C WebGPU Community Group does not prescribe a particular
pronunciation of "WGSL".

You can say it letter-by-letter, like "W G S L".

Other pronunciations are likely to emerge, and the community will
find its favourites.


## Where can I find the spec?

The WGSL spec will be developed on the WebGPU Community Group area on GitHub.
See https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/tree/master/wgsl

## What do you mean by "faithful" and "simply"?

For further clarification, see [gpuweb issue
586](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/586).

We plan to update the Goals section of the WGSL spec itself.
(See https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/588)


## Where do I provide feedback on WGSL?

To provide feedback on WGSL, file an issue on the spec repo site:
https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues

Please use a `[wgsl]` prefix on the issue title.
A Community Group member with write access to the repo will apply a
[`wgsl` label](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awgsl).


## What does a WGSL shader look like?

WGSL has not yet been specified, and is actively being designed.
However, early prototyping work indicates the language can have a look
and feel as represented in the following examples:

A simple fragment shader:


```
[[location 0]] var<out> gl_FragColor : vec4<f32>;

fn main() -> void {
    gl_FragColor = vec4<f32>(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0);
    return;
}
entry_point fragment = main;
```


A code fragment showing if/else:


```
  if (value > 5) {
    wvar = 14;
  } elseif (value > 2) {
    wvar = 12;
  } else {
    wvar = 0;
  }
```


A code fragment showing a switch:


```
switch (a) {
  case 1: {
    # The break is implicit
  }
  case 2: {
     fallthrough;
  }
  default: {
  }
}
```


A code fragment showing a loop:


```
var i : i32 = 0;
var b : f32 = 2.4;
loop {
  break if (i == 4);

  b = b * 3.2;
  continuing {
     i = i + 1;
  }
}
```

Again, please note that WGSL is still under heavy development at this time.
See above for how you can provide feedback.


## What browsers support WGSL?

WGSL is the shader language for WebGPU.
Any browser implementing WebGPU will be required to accept shaders in WGSL.
Specifically, the WebGPU conformance test suite will only use shaders written
in WGSL.

WGSL being a brand new effort, no browsers implement it at this time.
Support for WGSL is expected to replace support for other shading languages
in all WebGPU prototypes before WebGPU is released.

## Will browsers accept other shader languages for WebGPU?

Accepting a shader language other than WGSL is not part of WebGPU.
Doing so harms interoperability, as a shader in that other language is
not portable across browsers.


## Where can I find WGSL tooling?

The WebGPU Community Group does not deliver tooling for WGSL.
However, WebGPU implementers are expected to develop tooling
for handling WGSL, including parsing, validation, and compilation.

At this time, we expect at least three essentially independent
implementations of WGSL ingestion as part of browser support for WebGPU.
Independent implementation serves as an important check on the quality
of the WGSL and WebGPU specifications.


## What about my existing shaders, compilers, and other tooling?

This is also expressed as "the last thing I need is another shader language".
(See https://xkcd.com/927/)

For developers invested in the SPIR-V ecosystem for Vulkan and OpenGL,
the key will be convertibility between WGSL and SPIR-V.
For shaders that only use WebGPU features, WebGPU Community Group
members expect to develop tooling to faithfully convert between WGSL
and "Shader" SPIR-V.
By "faithful", we mean that all salient properties of a shader should
be preserved by a round trip conversion between the two ways of writing
the shader: e.g. it should retain its semantics and its performance
characteristics.
Furthermore, those WebGPU Community Group members plan to add an option
to existing mainstream SPIR-V compilers to emit WGSL directly.
We expect other SPIR-V tooling (e.g. fuzzers, optimizers) can be reused,
via the addition of a conversion step between WGSL and SPIR-V at their
I/O boundaries.
