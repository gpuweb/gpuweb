This is the repository for the W3C
[GPU for the Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/)
WebGPU API and WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) specifications.
This specification is formally standardized by the W3C
[GPU for the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2020/gpu/).

We use the [wiki](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki) and issue tracker as
the main sources of information related to the work.
This repository will hold the actual specification, examples, etc.

maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/gpuweb/admin).

## Membership

[Membership in the Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) is open
