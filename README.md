<img alt="WebGPU logo" src="logo/webgpu-responsive.svg" width="400">

This is the repository for the W3C
[GPU for the Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/)
WebGPU API and WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) specifications.
This specification is formally standardized by the W3C
[GPU for the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2020/gpu/).

We use the [wiki](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki) and issue tracker as
the main sources of information related to the work.
This repository will hold the actual specification, examples, etc.

## Charter

The [charter for this group](https://gpuweb.github.io/admin/cg-charter.html) is
maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/gpuweb/admin).

## Membership

[Membership in the Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) is open
to anyone. We especially encourage hardware vendors, browser engine developers,
3d software engineers and any Web Developers with expertise in graphics to
participate. You'll need a W3C account to join, and if you're affiliated with a
W3C member, your W3C representative will confirm your participation. If you're
not a W3C member, you're still welcome. All participants are required to agree
to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

## Contributions

You are not required to be a member of the Community Group or Working Group in order to
[file issues](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues), errors, fixes or make suggestions.
Anyone with a GitHub account can do so.

In order to assure that WebGPU specifications can be implemented on a Royalty-Free
(RF) basis, all significant contributions need to be made with RF commitments.
Members of the Working Group, and members of the Community Group who have signed the
[Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/fsa-deed/)

[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20200915/).
Non-members will be requested to provide an RF commitment under terms similar to
the W3C Patent Policy.

All contributions must comply with the group's
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/gpuweb/admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
