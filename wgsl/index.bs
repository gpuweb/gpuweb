# Introduction # {#intro}

WebGPU Shading Language ([SHORTNAME]) is the shader language for [[!WebGPU]].
That is, an application using the WebGPU API uses [SHORTNAME] to express the programs, known as shaders,
that run on the GPU.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn main() -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
        return vec4<f32>(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0);
    }
  </xmp>
</div>


## Goals ## {#goals}

 * Trivially convertable to [[!SPIR-V]]
 * Constructs are defined as normative references to their [[!SPIR-V]] counterparts
 * All features in [SHORTNAME] are directly translatable to [[!SPIR-V]]. (No polymorphism, no general pointers, no overloads, etc)
 * Features and semantics are exactly the ones of [[!SPIR-V]]
 * Each item in this spec *must* provide the mapping to [[!SPIR-V]] for the construct

## Technical Overview ## {#technical-overview}

WebGPU issues a unit of work to the GPU in the form of a [[WebGPU#gpu-command|GPU command]].
[SHORTNAME] is concerned with two kinds of GPU commands:
* a <dfn noexport>draw command</dfn> executes a [=GPURenderPipeline|render pipeline=]
    in the context of [=pipeline input|inputs=], [=pipeline output|outputs=], and attached [=resources=].
* a <dfn noexport>dispatch command</dfn> executes a [=GPUComputePipeline|compute pipeline=]
    in the context of [=pipeline input|inputs=] and attached [=resources=].

Both kinds of pipelines use shaders written in [SHORTNAME].

A <dfn noexport>shader</dfn> is the portion of a [SHORTNAME] program that executes a [=shader stage=] in a pipeline.
A shader comprises:
* An [=entry point=] [=function/function=].
* The transitive closure of all called functions, starting with the entry point.
    This set includes both [=user-defined function|user-defined=] and [=built-in function|built-in=] functions.
    (For a more rigorous definition, see "[=functions in a shader stage=]".)
* The set of variables and constants [=statically accessed=] by all those functions.
* The set of types used to define or analyze all those functions, variables, and constants.

When executing a shader stage, the implementation:
* Binds [=resources=] to variables in the shader's [=resource interface of a shader|resource interface=],
    making the contents of those resources available to the shader during execution.
* Allocates storage for other [=module scope|module-scope=] variables,
    and populates that storage with the specified initial values.
* Populates the formal parameters of the entry point, if they exist, with the stage's pipeline inputs.
* Connects the entry point return value, if one exists, to the stage's pipeline outputs.
* Then it invokes the entry point.

A [SHORTNAME] program is organized into:
* Functions, which specify execution behaviour.
* Statements, which are declarations or units of executable behaviour.
* Literals, which are text representations for pure mathematical values.
* Constants, each providing a name for a value computed at a specific time.
* Variables, each providing a name for storage for holding a value.
* Expressions, each of which combines a set of values to produce a result value.
* Types, each of which describes:
    * A set of values.
    * Constraints on supported expressions.
    * The semantics of those expressions.

[SHORTNAME] is an imperative language: behaviour is specified as a sequence of statements to execute.
Statements:
* Declare constants or variables
* Modify the contents of variables
* Modify execution order using structured programming constructs:
    * Selective execution: if/else/elseif, switch
    * Repetition: loop, for
    * Escaping a nested execution construct: break, continue
    * Refactoring: function call and return
    * Discard (fragment shaders only): terminating the invocation and throwing away the output
* Evaluate expressions to compute values as part of the above behaviours.

[SHORTNAME] is statically typed: each value computed by a particular expression is in a specific type,
determined only by examining the program source.

[SHORTNAME] has types to describe booleans, numbers, vectors, matrices, and aggregations
of these in the form of arrays and structures.
Additional types describe memory.

[SHORTNAME] does not have implicit conversions or promotions between numeric or boolean types.
Converting a value from one numeric or boolean type to another requires
an explicit [[#conversion-expr|conversion]],
[[#type-constructor-expr|construction]], or [[#bitcast-expr|reinterpretation of bits]].
This also applies to vector types.

[SHORTNAME] has texture and sampler types.
Together with their associated built-in functions, these support functionality
commonly used for graphics rendering, and commonly provided by GPUs.

The work of a shader stage is partitioned into one or more <dfn noexport>invocations</dfn>,
each of which executes the entry point, but under slightly different conditions.
Invocations in a shader stage share access to certain variables:
* All invocations in the stage share the resources in the shader interface.
* In a [=compute shader stage|compute shader=], invocations in the same
     [=compute shader stage/workgroup=] share
     variables in the [=storage classes/workgroup=] [=storage class=].
     Invocations in different workgroups do not share those variables.

However, the invocations act on different sets of pipeline inputs, including built-in inputs
that provide an identifying value to distinguish an invocation from its peers.
Also, each invocation has its own independent storage space in the form
of variables in the [=storage classes/private=] and [=storage classes/function=] storage classes.

Invocations within a shader stage execute concurrently, and may often execute in parallel.
The shader author is responsible for ensuring the dynamic behaviour of the invocations
in a shader stage:
* Meet the uniformity requirements of certain primitive operations, including texture sampling and control barriers.
* Coordinate potentially conflicting accesses to shared variables, to avoid race conditions.

[SHORTNAME] sometimes permits several possible behaviours for a given feature.
This is a portability hazard, as different implementations may exhibit the different behaviours.
The design of [SHORTNAME] aims to minimize such cases, but is constrained by feasibility,
and goals for achieving high performance across a broad range of devices.

## Notation ## {#notation}

The <dfn noexport>floor expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x|:

* &lfloor;|x|&rfloor; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k| &le; |x| &lt; |k|+1

The <dfn noexport>ceiling expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x|:

* &lceil;|x|&rceil; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k|-1 &lt; |x| &le; |k|

The <dfn noexport>roundUp</dfn> function is defined for positive integers |k| and |n| as:

* roundUp(|k|, |n|) = &lceil;|n| &div; |k|&rceil; &times; |k|

The <dfn noexport>transpose</dfn> of an |n|-column |m|-row matrix |A| is the |m|-column |n|-row matrix
|A|<sup>T</sup> formed by copying the rows of |A| as the columns of |A|<sup>T</sup>:

* transpose(|A|) = |A|<sup>T</sup>
* transpose(|A|)<sub>|i|,|j|</sub> = |A|<sub>|j|,|i|</sub>

The transpose of a column vector is defined by interpreting the column vector as a 1-row matrix.
Similarly, the transpose of a row vector is defined by interpreting the row vector as a 1-column matrix.

# Shader Lifecycle # {#program-lifecycle}

There are four key events in the lifecycle of a [SHORTNAME] program and the shaders it may contain.
The first two correspond to the WebGPU API methods used to prepare a [SHORTNAME] program
for execution.
The last two are the start and end of execution of a shader.

The events are:

1. <dfn noexport>Shader module creation</dfn>
    * This occurs when the
        [[WebGPU#dom-gpudevice-createshadermodule|WebGPU createShaderModule]] method
        is called.
        The source text for a [SHORTNAME] program is provided at this time.
2. <dfn noexport>Pipeline creation</dfn>
    * This occurs when the
        [[WebGPU#dom-gpudevice-createcomputepipeline|WebGPU createComputePipeline]] method
        or the
        [[WebGPU#dom-gpudevice-createrenderpipeline|WebGPU createRenderPipeline]] method
        is invoked.
        These methods use one or more previously created shader modules, together with other
        configuration information.
3. <dfn noexport>Shader execution start</dfn>
    * This occurs when a [=draw command|draw=] or [=dispatch command=] is issued to the GPU,
        begins executing the pipeline,
        and invokes the [=shader stage=] [=entry point=] function.
4. <dfn noexport>Shader execution end</dfn>
    * This occurs when all work in the shader completes:
        * all its [=invocations=] terminate
        * and all accesses to [=resources=] complete
        * outputs, if any, are passed to downstream pipeline stages.

The events are ordered due to:
*  data dependencies: shader execution requires a pipeline, and a pipeline requires a shader module.
*  causality: the shader must start executing before it can finish executing.

## Kinds of errors ## {#kinds-of-errors}

A <dfn export>program error</dfn> is a failure to satisfy the requirements of this specification.

There are three kinds of errors, corresponding to the shader lifecycle:

* A <dfn export>shader-creation error</dfn>
    is an error feasibly detectable at [=shader module creation=] time.
    Detection must rely only on the [SHORTNAME] program source text
    and other information available to the `createShaderModule` API method.

* A <dfn export>pipeline-creation error</dfn>
    is an error feasibly detectable at [=pipeline creation=] time.
    Detection must rely only on the [SHORTNAME] program source text
    and other information available to the particular pipeline creation API method.

* A <dfn export>dynamic error</dfn> is an error occurring during shader execution.
    These errors may or may not be detectable.

Note: For example, a race condition may not be detectable.

Each requirement in this specification corresponds to a single kind of error.
Generally, a requirement corresponds to the earliest error kind at which its violation could be feasibly detected.
When unclear, the corresponding error kind is explicitly specified.

The WebGPU specification describes the consequences of each kind of error.

TODO: Update the WebGPU spec, referring back to the three kinds of errors defined here.

# Textual structure # {#textual-structure}

A [SHORTNAME] program is text.
This specification does not prescribe a particular encoding for that text.
However, UTF-8 is always a valid encoding for a [SHORTNAME] program.

Note: The intent of promoting UTF-8 like this is to simplify interchange of [SHORTNAME] programs
and to encourage interoperability among tools.

[SHORTNAME] program text consists of a sequence of characters, grouped into contiguous non-empty sets forming:
* [=comments=]
* [=tokens=]
* [=blankspace=]

<dfn>Blankspace</dfn> is any combination of one or more of the following characters:
* space
* tab
* linefeed
* vertical tab
* formfeed
* carriage return

Issue: What else should be blankspace? Anything in the Unicode Separator category?

To parse a [SHORTNAME] program:
1. Remove comments:
    * Replace the first comment with a space character.
    * Repeat until no comments remain.
2. Scanning from beginning to end, group the remaining characters into tokens and blankspace
    in greedy fashion:
    * The next group is formed from the longest
        non-empty prefix of the remaining ungrouped characters, that is either:
        * a valid token, or
        * blankspace
    * Repeat until no ungrouped characters remain.
3. Discard the blankspace, leaving only tokens.
3. Parse the token sequence, attempting to match the `translation_unit` grammar rule.

<pre class='def'>
translation_unit
  : global_decl_or_directive*
</pre>

A [=shader-creation error=] results if:
* the entire source text cannot be converted into a finite sequence of valid tokens, or
* the `translation_unit` grammar rule does not match the entire token sequence.

## Comments ## {#comments}

A <dfn>comment</dfn> is a span of text that does not influence the validity or meaning of a [SHORTNAME]
program, except that a comment can separate [=tokens=].
Shader authors can use comments to document their programs.

A <dfn noexport>line-ending comment</dfn> is a kind of [=comment=] consisting
of the two characters `//` and the characters that follow,
up until the next linefeed or the end of the program.

TODO(dneto): Incorporate block comments, per https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1470

## Tokens ## {#tokens}

A <dfn>token</dfn> is a contiguous sequence of characters forming one of:
* a [=literal=].
* a [=keyword=].
* a [=reserved word=].
* a [=syntactic token=].
* an [=identifier=].

## Literals ## {#literals}

A <dfn>literal</dfn> is one of:
* a <dfn>numeric literal</dfn>, used to represent a number.
* a <dfn noexport>boolean literal</dfn>: either `true` or `false`.

The form of a [=numeric literal=] is defined via pattern-matching:
<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Numeric literal<th>Textual pattern
  </thead>
  <tr><td>`DECIMAL_FLOAT_LITERAL`<td>`(-?[0-9]*\.[0-9]+|-?[0-9]+\.[0-9]*)((e|E)(\+|-)?[0-9]+)?`
  <tr><td>`HEX_FLOAT_LITERAL`<td>`-?0x([0-9a-fA-F]*\.?[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9a-fA-F]+\.[0-9a-fA-F]*)(p|P)(\+|-)?[0-9]+`
  <tr><td>`INT_LITERAL`<td>`-?0x[0-9a-fA-F]+|0|-?[1-9][0-9]*`
  <tr><td>`UINT_LITERAL`<td>`0x[0-9a-fA-F]+u|0u|[1-9][0-9]*u`
</table>

Note: literals are parsed greedily. This means that for statements like `a -5`
      this will *not* parse as `a` `minus` `5` but instead as `a` `-5` which
      may be unexpected. A space must be inserted after the `-` if the first
      expression is desired.

TODO(dneto): Describe how numeric literal tokens map to idealized values, and then to typed values.

<pre class='def'>
const_literal
  : INT_LITERAL
  | UINT_LITERAL
  | FLOAT_LITERAL
  | TRUE
  | FALSE
</pre>

<pre class='def'>
FLOAT_LITERAL
  : DECIMAL_FLOAT_LITERAL
  | HEX_FLOAT_LITERAL
</pre>


## Keywords ## {#keywords}

A <dfn>keyword</dfn> is a [=token=] which always refers to a predefined language concept.
See [[#keyword-summary]] for the list of [SHORTNAME] keywords.

## Identifiers ## {#identifiers}

An <dfn>identifier</dfn> is a kind of [=token=] used as a name.
See [[#declaration-and-scope]] and [[#directives]].

The form of an identifier is defined via pattern-matching, except that
an identifier must not have the same spelling as a [=keyword=] or as a [=reserved word=].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Token<th>Textual pattern
  </thead>
  <tr><td>`IDENT`<td>`[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]*`
</table>

## Attributes ## {#attributes}

An <dfn noexport>attribute</dfn> modifies an object or type.
[SHORTNAME] provides a unified syntax for applying attributes.
Attributes are used for a variety of purposes such as specifying the interface with the API.
Generally speaking, from the language's point-of-view, attributes can be
ignored for the purposes of type and semantic checking.

An attribute must not be specified more than once per object or type.

<pre class='def'>
attribute_list
  : ATTR_LEFT (attribute COMMA)* attribute ATTR_RIGHT

attribute
  : IDENT PAREN_LEFT (literal_or_ident COMMA)* literal_or_ident PAREN_RIGHT
  | IDENT

literal_or_ident
  : FLOAT_LITERAL
  | INT_LITERAL
  | UINT_LITERAL
  | IDENT
</pre>

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Attributes defined in [SHORTNAME]</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Attribute<th>Valid Values<th>Description
  </thead>

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`align`</dfn>
    <td>positive i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to a member of a [=structure=] type.

    Must be a power of 2.

    See memory layout [alignment and size](#alignment-and-size).

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`binding`
    <td>non-negative i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to a [=resource=] variable.

    Specifies the binding number of the resource in a bind [=attribute/group=].
    See [[#resource-interface]].

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`block`</dfn>
    <td>*None*
    <td>Must only be applied to a [=structure=] type.

    Indicates this structure type represents the contents of a buffer
    resource occupying a single binding slot in the [=resource interface of a
    shader|shader's resource interface=].

    The `block` attribute must be applied to a structure type used as the
    [=store type=] of a [=uniform buffer=] or [=storage buffer=] variable.

    A structure type with the block attribute must not be:
    * the element type of an [=array=] type
    * the member type in another structure

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`builtin`
    <td>a builtin variable identifier
    <td>Must only be applied to an entry point function parameter, entry point
    return type, or member of a [=structure=].

    Declares a builtin variable.
    See [[#builtin-variables]].

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`group`
    <td>non-negative i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to a [=resource=] variable.

    Specifies the binding group of the resource.
    See [[#resource-interface]].

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`interpolate`
    <td>One or two parameters.

    The first parameter must be an [=interpolation type=].
    The second parameter, if present, must specify the [=interpolation sampling=].
    <td>Must only be applied to an entry point function parameter, entry point
    return type, or member of a [=structure=] type.
    Must only be applied to declarations of scalars or vectors of floating-point type.
    Must not be used with the [=compute=] shader stage.

    Specifies how the user-defined IO must be interpolated.
    The attribute is only significant on user-defined [=vertex=] outputs
    and [=fragment=] inputs.
    See [[#interpolation]].

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`invariant`
    <td>*None*
    <td>Must only be applied to the `position` built-in variable.

    When applied to the `position` [=built-in output variable=] of a vertex
    shader, the computation of the result is invariant across different
    programs and different invocations of the same entry point.
    That is, if the data and control flow match for two `position` outputs in
    different entry points, then the result values are guaranteed to be the
    same.
    There is no affect on a `position` [=built-in input variable=].

    Note: this attribute maps to the `Invariant` decoration in SPIR-V, the
    `precise` qualifier in HLSL, and the `invariant` qualifier in GLSL.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`location`
    <td>non-negative i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to an entry point function parameter, entry point
    return type, or member of a [=structure=] type.
    Must only be applied to declarations of [=numeric scalar=] or [=numeric
    vector=] type.
    Must not be used with the [=compute=] shader stage.

    Specifies a part of the user-defined IO of an entry point.
    See [[#input-output-locations]].

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`override`
    <td>An optional, non-negative i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to module scope constant declaration of [=scalar=] type.

    Specifies a [=pipeline-overridable=] constant.
    In the WebGPU API, pipeline overridable constants are specified by the identifier
    of the constant the attribute is applied to.
    If the optional parameter is specified, the pipeline overridable constant
    is referred to by the numeric id specified instead.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`size`</dfn>
    <td>positive i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to a member of a [=structure=] type.

    The number of bytes reserved in the struct for this member.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`stage`</dfn>
    <td>`compute`, `vertex`, or `fragment`
    <td>Must only be applied to a function declaration.

    Declares an entry point by specifying its pipeline stage.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`stride`</dfn>
    <td>positive i32 literal
    <td>Must only be applied to an [=array=] type.

    The number of bytes from the start of one element of the array to the
    start of the next element.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="attribute">`workgroup_size`</dfn>
    <td>One, two or three parameters.

    Each parameter is either a literal or [[#module-constants|module-scope constant]].
    All parameters must be of the same type, either i32 or u32.
    <td>Must be applied to a [=compute shader stage|compute shader=] entry point function.
    Must not be applied to any other object.

    Specifies the x, y, and z dimensions of the [=workgroup grid=] for the compute shader.

    The first parameter specifies the x dimension.
    The second parameter, if provided, specifies the y dimension, otherwise is assumed to be 1.
    The third parameter, if provided, specifies the z dimension, otherwise is assumed to be 1.
    Each dimension must be at least 1 and at most an upper bound specified by the WebGPU API.

## Directives ## {#directives}

A <dfn noexport>directive</dfn> is a [=token=] sequence which modifies how a [SHORTNAME]
program is processed by a WebGPU implementation.
See [[#enable-directive-section]].

## Declaration and scope ## {#declaration-and-scope}

A <dfn noexport>declaration</dfn> associates an [=identifier=] with one of
the following kinds of objects:
* a type
* a value
* a variable
* a function
* a formal parameter

In other words, a declaration introduces a <dfn noexport>name</dfn> for an object.
A name cannot be used before it is declared.

The <dfn noexport>scope</dfn> of a declaration is the set of
program locations where a use of the declared identifier potentially denotes
its associated object.
We say the identifier is <dfn noexport>in scope</dfn>
(of the declaration) at those source locations.

Each kind of declaration has its own rule for determining its scope.
In general the scope is a span of text beginning immediately after the end of the
declaration.

Certain objects are provided by the WebGPU implementation,
and are treated as if they have already been declared at the start of a [SHORTNAME] program.
We say such objects are <dfn noexport>predeclared</dfn>.
Their scope is the entire [SHORTNAME] program.
Examples of predeclared objects are:
* [=built-in functions=], and
* built-in types.

A declaration must not introduce a name when that identifier is
already in scope with the same end scope as another instance of that name.
When an identifier is used in scope of one or more declarations for that name,
the identifier will denote the object of the declaration appearing closest to
that use.
We say the identifier use <dfn noexport>resolves</dfn> to that declaration.

Note: A declaration always precedes its identifier's scope.
Therefore, the nearest in scope declaration of an identifier always precedes the
use of the identifier.

<div class='example' heading='Valid and invalid declarations'>
  <xmp>
    // Invalid, cannot reuse built-in function names.
    var<private> modf: f32 = 0.0;

      // References to 'bar' resolve to bar_2
      {

          // Invalid, i_2 has the same end scope as i_1.
          var i: i32 = 1; // i_2.
        }
      }

      // Invalid, bar_5 has the same end scope as bar_2.
      var bar: u32; // bar_5
    }

    // Invalid, bar_6 has the same end scope as bar_1.
    var<private> bar: u32 = 1u; // bar_6

    fn my_foo(
      // Valid, my_foo_2 is in scope until the end of the function.
      my_foo: i32 // my_foo_2
    ) { }
  </xmp>
</div>

There are multiple levels of scoping depending on how and where things are
declared.

When an identifier is used, it must be in scope for some declaration, or as part of a directive.

A declaration is at <dfn noexport>module scope</dfn> if the declaration appears outside
the text of any other declaration.

Note: Only a [=function declaration=] can contain other declarations.

# Types # {#types}

Programs calculate values.

In [SHORTNAME], a <dfn noexport>type</dfn> is set of values, and each value belongs to exactly one type.
A value's type determines the syntax and semantics of operations that can be performed on that value.

For example, the mathematical number 1 corresponds to three distinct values in [SHORTNAME]:
* the 32-bit signed integer value `1`,
* the 32-bit unsigned integer value `1u`, and
* the 32-bit floating point value `1.0`.

[SHORTNAME] treats these as different because their machine representation and operations differ.

A type is either [=predeclared=], or created in WGSL source via a [=declaration=].

We distinguish between the *concept* of a type and the *syntax* in [SHORTNAME] to denote that type.
In many cases the spelling of a type in this specification is the same as its [SHORTNAME] syntax.
For example:
* the set of 32-bit unsigned integer values is spelled `u32` in this specification,
    and also in a [SHORTNAME] program.
* the spelling is different for structure types, or types containing structures.

Some [SHORTNAME] types are only used for analyzing a source program and
for determining the program's runtime behaviour.
This specification will describe such types, but they do not appear in [SHORTNAME] source text.

Note: [SHORTNAME] [=reference types=] are not written in [SHORTNAME] programs. See TODO forward reference to ptr/ref.

## Type Checking ## {#type-checking-section}

A [SHORTNAME] value is computed by evaluating an expression.
An <dfn noexport>expression</dfn> is a segment of source text
parsed as one of the [SHORTNAME] grammar rules whose name ends with "`_expression`".
An expression *E* can contain <dfn noexport>subexpressions</dfn> which are expressions properly contained
in the outer expression *E*.

The particular value produced by an expression evaluation depends on:
* <dfn noexport>static context</dfn>:
    the source text surrounding the expression, and
* <dfn noexport>dynamic context</dfn>:
    the state of the invocation evaluating the expression,
    and the execution context in which the invocation is running.

The values that may result from evaluating a particular expression will always belong to a specific [SHORTNAME] type,
known as the <dfn noexport>static type</dfn> of the expression.
The rules of [SHORTNAME] are designed so that the static type of an expression depends only on the expression's static context.

Statements often use expressions, and may place requirements on the static types of those expressions.
For example:
* The condition expression of an `if` statement must be of type [=bool=].
* In a `let` declaration, the initializer must evaluate to the declared type of the constant.

<dfn noexport>Type checking</dfn> a successfully parsed [SHORTNAME] program is the process of mapping
each expression to its static type,
and determining if the type requirements of each statement are satisfied.

A <dfn noexport>type assertion</dfn> is a mapping from some [SHORTNAME] source expression to a [SHORTNAME] type.
The notation

> *e* : *T*

is a type assertion meaning *T* is the static type of [SHORTNAME] expression *e*.

Note: A type assertion is a statement of fact about the text of a program.
It is not a runtime check.

Finding static types for expressions can be performed by recursively applying type rules.
A <dfn noexport>type rule</dfn> has two parts:
* A conclusion, stated as a type assertion for an expression.
    The expression in the type assertion is specified schematically,
    using *italicized* names to denote subexpressions
    or other syntactically-determined parameters.
* Preconditions, consisting of:
    * Type assertions for subexpressions, when there are subexpressions.
    * Conditions on the other schematic parameters, if any.
    * How the expression is used in a statement.
    * Optionally, other static context.

A <dfn noexport>type rule applies to an expression</dfn> when:
* The rule's conclusion matches a valid parse of the expression, and
* The rule's preconditions are satisfied.

TODO: write an example such as `1+2`, or `3 - a`, where `a` is in-scope of a let declaration with `i32` type.

The type rules are designed so that if parsing succeeds, at most one type rule will apply to each expression.
If a type rule applies to an expression, then the conclusion is asserted, and therefore determines the static type of the expression.

A [SHORTNAME] source program is <dfn noexport>well-typed</dfn> when:
* The static type can be determined for each expression in the program by applying the type rules, and
* The type requirements for each statement are satisfied.

Otherwise there is a <dfn noexport>type error</dfn> and the source program is not a valid [SHORTNAME] program.

[SHORTNAME] is a <dfn noexport>statically typed language</dfn>
because type checking a [SHORTNAME] program will either succeed or
discover a type error, while only having to inspect the program source text.

TODO(dneto): Lazy-decay is a tie-breaking rule. The above description can accomodate it by
using priority-levels on potentially-matching type rules.

### Type rule tables ### {#typing-tables-section}

The [SHORTNAME] [=type rules=] are organized into <dfn noexport>type rule tables</dfn>,
with one row per type rule.

The <dfn noexport>semantics of an expression</dfn> is the effect of evaluating that expression,
and is primarily the production of a result value.
The *Description* column of the type rule that applies to an expression will specify the expression's semantics.
The semantics usually depends on the values of the type rule parameters, including
the assumed values of any subexpressions.
Sometimes the semantics of an expression includes effects other than producing
a result value, such as the non-result-value effects of its subexpressions.

TODO: example: non-result-value effect is any side effect of a function call subexpression.

## Plain Types ## {#plain-types-section}

[=Plain types=] are the types for representing boolean values, numbers, vectors,
matrices, or aggregations of such values.

A <dfn>plain type</dfn> is either a [=scalar=] type, an [=atomic type|atomic=] type, or a [=composite=] type.

Note: Plain types in [SHORTNAME] are similar to Plain-Old-Data types in C++, but also include atomic types.

### Boolean Type ### {#bool-type}

The <dfn dfn noexport>bool</dfn> type contains the values `true` and `false`.

### Integer Types ### {#integer-types}

The <dfn dfn noexport>u32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit unsigned integers.

The <dfn noexport>i32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit signed integers.
It uses a two's complementation representation, with the sign bit in the most significant bit position.

### Floating Point Type ### {#floating-point-types}

The <dfn noexport>f32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit floating point values of the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary32 (single precision) format.
See [[#floating-point-evaluation]] for details.

### Scalar Types ### {#scalar-types}

The <dfn dfn noexport>scalar</dfn> types are [=bool=], [=i32=], [=u32=], and [=f32=].

The <dfn dfn noexport>numeric scalar</dfn> types are [=i32=], [=u32=], and [=f32=].

The <dfn dfn noexport>integer scalar</dfn> types are [=i32=] and [=u32=].

### Vector Types ### {#vector-types}

A <dfn noexport>vector</dfn> is a grouped sequence of 2, 3, or 4 [=scalar=] components.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td>vec*N*<*T*><td>Vector of *N* elements of type *T*.
                          *N* must be in {2, 3, 4} and *T*
                          must be one of the [=scalar=] types.
                          We say *T* is the <dfn noexport>component type</dfn> of the vector.
</table>

A vector is a <dfn dfn>numeric vector</dfn> if its component type is a [=numeric scalar=].

Key use cases of a vector include:

* to express both a direction and a magnitude.
* to express a position in space.
* to express a color in some color space.
    For example, the components could be intensities of red, green, and blue,
    while the fourth component could be an alpha (opacity) value.

Many operations on vectors act <dfn noexport>component-wise</dfn>, i.e. the
result vector is formed by operating on each component independently.

<div class='example wgsl type-scope' heading='Vector'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    vec2<f32>  // is a vector of two f32s.
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example component-wise addition' heading='Component-wise addition'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    let x : vec3<f32> = a + b; // a and b are vec3<f32>
    // x[0] = a[0] + b[0]
    // x[1] = a[1] + b[1]
    // x[2] = a[2] + b[2]
  </xmp>
</div>

### Matrix Types ### {#matrix-types}

A <dfn noexport>matrix</dfn> is a grouped sequence of 2, 3, or 4 floating point vectors.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="matrix type">
    <td>mat|N|x|M|&lt;f32&gt;
    <td>Matrix of |N| columns and |M| rows, where |N| and |M| are both in {2, 3, 4}.
        Equivalently, it can be viewed as |N| column vectors of type vec|M|&lt;f32&gt;.
</table>

The key use case for a matrix is to embody a linear transformation.
In this interpretation, the vectors of a matrix are treated as column vectors.

The product operator (`*`) is used to either:

* scale the transformation by a scalar magnitude.
* apply the transformation to a vector.
* combine the transformation with another matrix.

See [[#arithmetic-expr]].

<div class='example wgsl type-scope' heading='Matrix'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    mat2x3<f32>  // This is a 2 column, 3 row matrix of 32-bit floats.
                 // Equivalently, it is 2 column vectors of type vec3<f32>.
  </xmp>
</div>

### Atomic Types ### {#atomic-types}

An <dfn noexport>atomic type</dfn> encapsulates a [=scalar=] type such that:
* atomic objects provide certain guarantees to concurrent observers, and
* the only valid operations on atomic objects are the [[#atomic-builtin-functions|atomic builtin functions]].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="atomic type"><td>atomic&lt;|T|&gt;
    <td>Atomic of type |T|. |T| must be either [=u32=] or [=i32=].
</table>

An expression must not evaluate to an atomic type.

Atomic types may only be instantiated by variables in the [=storage classes/workgroup=]
storage class or by [=storage buffer=] variables with a [=access/read_write=] access mode.

An <dfn noexport>atomic modification</dfn> is any operation on an atomic object which sets the content of the object.
The operation counts as a modification even if the new value is the same as the object's existing value.

In [SHORTNAME], atomic modifications are mutually ordered, for each object.
That is, during execution of a shader stage, for each atomic object *A*, all
agents observe the same order of modification operations applied to *A*.
The ordering for distinct atomic objects may not be related in any way; no
causality is implied.
Note that variables in [=storage classes/workgroup=] storage are shared within a
[=compute shader stage/workgroup=], but are not shared between different
workgroups.

TODO: Add links the eventual memory model descriptions.

<div class='example storage atomic' heading='Mapping atomics in a storage variable to SPIR-V'>
  <xmp>
    [[block]] struct S {
      a: atomic<i32>;
      b: atomic<u32>;
    };

    [[group(0), binding(0)]]
    var<storage,read_write> x: S;

    // Maps to the following SPIR-V:
    // - When atomic types are members of a struct, the Volatile decoration
    //   is annotated on the member.
    // OpDecorate %S Block

    // %S = OpTypeStruct %i32 %u32
    // %ptr_storage_S = OpTypePointer StorageBuffer %S
    // %x = OpVariable %ptr_storage_S StorageBuffer
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example workgroup atomic' heading='Mapping atomics in a workgroup variable to SPIR-V'>
  <xmp>
    var<workgroup> x: atomic<u32>;

    // Maps to the following SPIR-V:
    // - When atomic types are directly instantiated by a variable,  the Volatile
    //   decoration is annotated on the OpVariable.
    // OpDecorate %x Volatile
    // ...
    // %u32 = OpTypeInt 32 0
    // %ptr_workgroup_u32 = OpTypePointer Workgroup %S
    // %x = OpVariable %ptr_workgroup_u32 Workgroup
  </xmp>
</div>


### Array Types ### {#array-types}

An <dfn noexport>array</dfn> is an indexable grouping of element values.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td algorithm="fixed-size array type">array&lt;|E|,|N|&gt;
      <td>A <dfn>fixed-size array</dfn> with |N| elements of type |E|.<br>
          |N| is called the <dfn noexport>element count</dfn> of the array.
  <tr><td algorithm="runtime-sized array type">array&lt;|E|&gt;
      <td>A <dfn noexport>runtime-sized</dfn> array of elements of type |E|.
          These may only appear in specific contexts.<br>
</table>

When specified, an element count expression |N| must:
* be a literal, or the name of a [[#module-constants|module-scope constant]] that is not [=pipeline-overridable=], and
* evaluate to an [=integer scalar=] with value greater than zero.

Note:  The element count value is fully determined at [=shader module creation=] time.

Two array types are the same if and only if all of the following are true:
* They have the same element type.
* Their element count specifications match, i.e. either of the following is true:
    * They are both runtime-sized.
    * They are both fixed-sized with equal-valued element counts,
        even if one is signed and the other is unsigned.
        (Signed and unsigned values are comparable in this case because element counts must
        be greater than zero.)

Issue: Array types should differ if they have different element strides.
See https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1534

<div class='example fixed-size array types' heading='Example fixed-size array types'>
  <xmp>
    // array<f32,8> and array<i32,8> are different types:
    // different element types
    var<private> a: array<f32,8>;
    var<private> b: array<i32,8>;
    var<private> c: array<i32,8u>;  // array<i32,8> and array<i32,8u> are the same type

    let width = 8;
    let height = 8;

    // array<i32,8>, array<i32,8u>, and array<i32,width> are the same type.
    // Their element counts evaluate to 8.
    var<private> d: array<i32,width>;

    // array<i32,height> and array<i32,width> are the same type.
    var<private> e: array<i32,width>;
    var<private> f: array<i32,height>;
  </xmp>
</div>

The first element in an array is at index 0, and each successive element is at the next integer index.
See [[#array-access-expr]].

An array element type must be one of:
* a [=scalar=] type
* a vector type
* a matrix type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* an array type
* a [=structure=] type

Note: That is, the element type must be a [=plain type=].

[SHORTNAME] defines the following attributes that can be applied to array types:
* [=attribute/stride=]

Restrictions on runtime-sized arrays:
* The last member of the structure type defining the [=store type=]
    for a variable in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class may be a runtime-sized array.
* A runtime-sized array must not be used as the store type or contained within
    a store type in any other cases.
* An expression must not evaluate to a runtime-sized array type.

### Structure Types ### {#struct-types}

A <dfn noexport>structure</dfn> is a grouping of named member values.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="structure type">
      <td>struct&lt;|T|<sub>1</sub>,...,|T|<sub>N</sub>&gt;
      <td>An ordered tuple of *N* members of types
          |T|<sub>1</sub> through |T|<sub>N</sub>, with |N| being an integer greater than 0.
          A structure type declaration specifies an [=identifier=] name for each member.
          Two members of the same structure type must not have the same name.
</table>

A structure member type must be one of:
* a [=scalar=] type
* a vector type
* a matrix type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* an array type
* a [=structure=] type

Note: That is, each member type must be a [=plain type=].

Note: The structure member type restriction and the array element type restriction are
mutually reinforcing.
Combined, they imply that a pointer may not appear in any level
of nesting within either an array or structure.
Similarly, the same limitations apply to textures and samplers.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Structure">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // A structure with two members.

[SHORTNAME] defines the following attributes that can be applied to structure members:
 * [=attribute/builtin=]
 * [=attribute/location=]
 * [=attribute/stride=]
 * [=attribute/align=]
 * [=attribute/size=]

Note: Layout attributes may be required if the structure type is used
to define a [=uniform buffer=] or a [=storage buffer=]. See [[#memory-layouts]].

### Composite Types ### {#composite-types}

A type is <dfn noexport>composite</dfn> if it has internal structure
expressed as a composition of other types.
The internal parts do not overlap, and are called <dfn noexport>components</dfn>.

The composite types are:

* [=vector=] type
* [=matrix=] type
* [=array=] type
* [=structure=] type

### Constructible Types ### {#constructible-types}

Many kinds of values can be created, loaded, stored, passed into functions,
and returned from functions.
We call these [=constructible=].

A type is <dfn>constructible</dfn> if it is one of:

* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type, if its element type is constructible.
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members are constructible.

Note: All constructible types are [=plain types|plain=].

Note: Atomic types and runtime-sized array types are not constructible.
Composite types containing atomics and runtime-sized arrays are not constructible.

## Memory ## {#memory}

In [SHORTNAME], a value of [=storable=] type may be stored in memory, for later retrieval.
This section describes the structure of memory, and how [SHORTNAME] types are used to
describe the contents of memory.

In general [SHORTNAME] follows the [[!VulkanMemoryModel|Vulkan Memory Model]].

### Memory Locations ### {#memory-locations-section}

Memory consists of a set of distinct <dfn noexport>memory locations</dfn>.
Each memory location is 8-bits
in size. An operation affecting memory interacts with a set of one or more
memory locations.

Two sets of memory locations <dfn noexport>overlap</dfn> if the intersection of
their sets of memory locations is non-empty. Each variable declaration has a
set of memory locations that does not overlap with the sets of memory locations of
any other variable declaration. Memory operations on structures and arrays may
access padding between elements, but must not access padding at the end of the
structure or array.

### Memory Access Mode ### {#memory-access-mode}

A <dfn noexport>memory access</dfn> is an operation that acts on memory locations.

* A <dfn noexport>read access</dfn> observes the contents of memory locations.
* A <dfn noexport>write access</dfn> sets the contents of memory locations.

A single operation can read, write, or both read and write.

Particular memory locations may support only certain kinds of accesses, expressed
as the memory's <dfn noexport>access mode</dfn>:

: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">read</dfn>
:: Supports read accesses, but not writes.
: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">write</dfn>
:: Supports write accesses, but not reads.
: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">read_write</dfn>
:: Supports both read and write accesses.

<pre class='def'>
access_mode
  : READ
  | WRITE
  | READ_WRITE
</pre>

### Storable Types ### {#storable-types}

The value contained in a [=variable=] must be of a [=storable=] type.
A storable type may have an explicit representation defined by WGSL,
as described in [[#internal-value-layout]],
or it may be opaque, such as for textures and samplers.

A type is <dfn dfn noexport>storable</dfn> if it is one of:

* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* an [=array=] type
* a [=structure=] type
* a [=texture=] type
* a [=sampler=] type

Note: That is, the storable types are the [=plain types=], texture types, and sampler types.

### IO-shareable Types ### {#io-shareable-types}

Pipeline input and output values must be of IO-shareable type.

A type is <dfn dfn noexport>IO-shareable</dfn> if it is one of:

* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=numeric vector=] type
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members are [=scalars=] or [=numeric vectors=]

The following kinds of values must be of IO-shareable type:

* Values read from or written to built-in variables.
* Values accepted as inputs from an upstream pipeline stage.
* Values written as output for downstream processing in the pipeline, or to an output attachment.

Note: Only built-in pipeline inputs may have a boolean type.
A user input or output data attribute must not be of [=bool=] type or contain a [=bool=] type.
See [[#pipeline-inputs-outputs]].

### Host-shareable Types ### {#host-shareable-types}

Host-shareable types are used to describe the contents of buffers which are shared between
the host and the GPU, or copied between host and GPU without format translation.
When used for this purpose, the type must be additionally decorated with layout attributes
as described in [[#memory-layouts]].
We will see in [[#module-scope-variables]] that the [=store type=] of [=uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=]
variables must be host-shareable.

A type is <dfn dfn noexport>host-shareable</dfn> if it is one of:

* a [=numeric scalar=] type
* a [=numeric vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type, if its element type is host-shareable
* a [=runtime-sized=] array type, if its element type is host-shareable
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members are host-shareable

[SHORTNAME] defines the following attributes that affect memory layouts:
 * [=attribute/stride=]
 * [=attribute/align=]
 * [=attribute/size=]

Note: An [=IO-shareable=] type *T* is host-shareable if *T* is not [=bool=] and does not contain [=bool=].
Many types are host-shareable, but not IO-shareable, including [=atomic types=],
[=runtime-sized=] arrays, and any composite types containing them.

Note: Both IO-shareable and host-shareable types have concrete sizes, but counted differently.
IO-shareable types are sized by a location-count metric, see [[#input-output-locations]].
Host-shareable types are sized by a byte-count metric, see [[#memory-layouts]].

### Storage Classes ### {#storage-class}

Memory locations are partitioned into <dfn noexport>storage classes</dfn>.
Each storage class has unique properties determining
mutability, visibility, the values it may contain,
and how to use variables with it.

<table class='data' id="storage-class-table">

</table>

Note: The token `handle` is reserved: it is never used in a [SHORTNAME] program.

Note: A texture variable holds an opaque handle which is used to access the underlying
grid of texels.
The handle itself is always read-only.
In most cases the underlying texels are read-only.
For a write-only storage texture, the underlying texels are write-only.

### Memory Layout ### {#memory-layouts}

[=Uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=] variables are used to share
bulk data organized as a sequence of bytes in memory.
Buffers are shared between the CPU and the GPU, or between different shader stages
in a pipeline, or between different pipelines.

Because buffer data are shared without reformatting or translation,
buffer producers and consumers must agree on the <dfn noexport>memory layout</dfn>,
which is the description of how the bytes in a buffer are organized into typed [SHORTNAME] values.

The [=store type=] of a buffer variable must be [=host-shareable=], with fully elaborated memory layout, as described below.

Each buffer variable must be declared in either the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage classes.

The memory layout of a type is significant only when evaluating an expression with:
* a variable in the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage class, or
* a pointer into the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.

An 8-bit byte is the most basic unit of [=host-shareable=] memory.
The terms defined in this section express counts of 8-bit bytes.

We will use the following notation:
* <dfn noexport>AlignOf</dfn>(|T|) is the alignment of host-shareable type |T|.
* <dfn noexport>AlignOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |M|) is the alignment of member |M| of the host-shareable structure |S|.
* <dfn noexport>SizeOf</dfn>(|T|) is the size of host-shareable type |T|.
* <dfn noexport>SizeOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |M|) is the size of member |M| of the host-shareable structure |S|.
* <dfn noexport>StrideOf</dfn>(|A|) is the [=element stride=] of host-shareable array type |A|.
* <dfn noexport>OffsetOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |M|) is the offset of member |M| from the start of the host-shareable structure |S|.


#### Alignment and Size ####  {#alignment-and-size}

Each [=host-shareable=] data type |T| has an alignment and size value, denoted
by [=AlignOf=](|T|) and [=SizeOf=](|T|), respectively.

Alignment guarantees that a value's address in memory will be a multiple of the
specified value. This can enable more efficient hardware instructions to be used
to access the value or satisfy more restrictive hardware requirements on certain
storage classes. (see [storage class layout constraints](#storage-class-layout-constraints)).

Note: Each alignment value is always a power of two, by construction.

The size of a type or structure member is the number of contiguous bytes
reserved in host-shareable memory for the purpose of storing a value of the type
or structure member.
The size may include non-addressable padding at the end of the type.
Consequently, loads and stores of a value might access fewer memory locations
than the value's size.

Alignment and size for host-shareable types are defined recursively in the
following table:

#### Structure Layout Rules ####  {#structure-layout-rules}

Each structure |S| member M<sub>N</sub> has a size and alignment value, denoted
by [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>) and [=AlignOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>), respectively.
The member sizes and alignments are used to calculate each member's byte offset from the start of the structure.

Structures member size and alignment values default to the member type `T`'s
[=SizeOf=](T) and [=AlignOf=](T) values.

If a structure member is decorated with the [=attribute/size=] decoration, then the structure
member will use the value of the decoration for its size instead of its type's size.

If a structure member is decorated with the [=attribute/align=] decoration, then the structure
member will use the value of the decoration for its alignment instead of its type's alignment.

The first structure member always has a zero byte offset from the start of the
structure.

Subsequent members have the following byte offset from the start of the structure:
<p algorithm="structure member offset">
  [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>), [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N-1</sub>) + [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N-1</sub>)<br>
  Where M<sub>N</sub> is the current member and M<sub>N-1</sub> is the previous member
</p>

Structure members must not overlap. If a structure member is decorated with the
[=attribute/size=] attribute, the value must be at least as large as the
size of the member's type:

<p algorithm="member size constraint">
  [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>) &ge; [=SizeOf=](T)<br>
  Where |T| is the type of member M<sub>N</sub>.
</p>


The alignment of a structure is equal to the largest alignment of all of its
members:
<p algorithm="structure alignment">
  [=AlignOf=](|S|) = max([=AlignOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>1</sub>), ... , [=AlignOfMember=](|S|, M<sub>N</sub>))
</p>

The size of a structure is equal to the offset plus the size of its last member,
rounded to the next multiple of the structure's alignment:
<p algorithm="structure size">
  [=SizeOf=](|S|) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOf=](|S|), [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, |L|) + [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, |L|))<br>
  Where |L| is the last member of the structure
</p>

#### Array Layout Rules ####  {#array-layout-rules}

The first array element always has a zero byte offset from the start of the
array.

The <dfn noexport>element stride</dfn> of an array is the number of bytes from the
start of one array element to the start of the next element.
It is determined as follows:
* It is the value of an explicit [=stride=] attribute on the type, if specified.
* Otherwise, it is the <dfn noexport>implicit stride</dfn>,
    equal to the size of the array's element type, rounded up to the alignment of
    the element type:

<p algorithm="array implicit element stride">
  [=StrideOf=](array<|T|[, |N|]>) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOf=](T), [=SizeOf=](T))
</p>

In all cases, the array element stride must be a multiple of the element alignment.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Implicit / explicit array element strides'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // Array with an implicit element stride of 16 bytes
    var implicit_stride: array<vec3<f32>, 8>;

    // Array with an explicit element stride of 32 bytes
    var explicit_stride: [[stride(32)]] array<vec3<f32>, 8>;
  </xmp>
</div>

Arrays decorated with the [=stride=] attribute must have a stride that is at
least the size of the element type, and be a multiple of the element type's
alignment value.

The array size (in bytes) is equal to the array's element stride multiplied by the number of
elements:
<p algorithm="array element stride">
  [=SizeOf=](array<|T|, |N|>) = [=StrideOf=](array<|T|, |N|>) &times; |N|<br>
  [=SizeOf=](array<|T|>) = [=StrideOf=](array<|T|>) &times; N<sub>runtime</sub>
</p>

The array alignment is equal to the element alignment:
<p algorithm="array alignment">
  [=AlignOf=](array<|T|[, N]>) = [=AlignOf=](|T|)
</p>

For example, the layout for a `[[stride(S)]] array<T, 3>` type is equivalent to
the following structure:

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Structure equivalent of a three element array'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct Array {
      [[size(S)]] element_0: T;
      [[size(S)]] element_1: T;
      [[size(S)]] element_2: T;
    };
  </xmp>
</div>

#### Internal Layout of Values ####  {#internal-value-layout}

This section describes how the internals of a value are placed in the byte locations
of a buffer, given an assumed placement of the overall value.
These layouts depend on the value's type, the [=attribute/stride=] attribute on
array types, and the [=attribute/align=] and [=attribute/size=] attributes on
structure type members.

The data will appear identically regardless of storage class.

When a value |V| of type [=u32=] or [=i32=] is placed at byte offset |k| of a
host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+2 contains bits 16 through 23 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+3 contains bits 24 through 31 of |V|

Note: Recall that [=i32=] uses twos-complement representation, so the sign bit
is in bit position 31.

A value |V| of type [=f32=] is represented in [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary32 format.
It has one sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23 fraction bits.
When |V| is placed at byte offset |k| of host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of the fraction.
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of the fraction.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+2 contain bits 16 through 23 of the fraction.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+2 contains bit 0 bit of the exponent.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+3 contain bits 1 through 7 of the exponent.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+3 contains the sign bit.

Note: The above rules imply that numeric values in host-shared buffers
are stored in little-endian format.

When a value |V| of [=atomic type=] `atomic`&lt;|T|&gt; is placed in a host-shared buffer,
it has the same internal layout as a value of the underlying type |T|.

When a value |V| of vector type vec|N|&lt;|T|&gt; is placed at
byte offset |k| of a host-shared buffer, then:
   * |V|.x is placed at byte offset |k|

   * If |N| &ge; 3, then |V|.z is placed at byte offset |k|+8
   * If |N| &ge; 4, then |V|.w is placed at byte offset |k|+12

When a matrix value |M| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer, then:
   * If |M| has 2 rows, then:
      * Column vector |i| of |M| is placed at byte offset |k| + 8 &times; |i|
   * If |M| has 3 or 4 rows, then:
      * Column vector |i| of |M| is placed at byte offset |k| + 16 &times; |i|

When a value of array type |A| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * Element |i| of the array is placed at byte offset |k| + |i| &times; [=StrideOf=](|A|)

When a value of structure type |S| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * The |i|'<sup>th</sup> member of the structure value is placed at byte offset |k| + [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|,|i|)


#### Storage Class Layout Constraints ####  {#storage-class-layout-constraints}

The [=storage classes/storage=] and [=storage classes/uniform=] storage classes
have different buffer layout constraints which are described in this section.

All structure and array types directly or indirectly referenced by a variable
must obey the constraints of the variable's storage class.
Violations of a storage class constraint result in a compile-time error.

In this section we define <dfn noexport>RequiredAlignOf</dfn>(|S|, |C|) as the
required byte offset alignment of values of host-shareable type |S| when
used by storage class |C|.

<table class='data'>

      <td>[=AlignOf=](|S|)
      <td>[=roundUp=](16, [=AlignOf=](|S|))<br>
</table>

Structure members of type |T| must have a byte offset
from the start of the structure that is a multiple of the [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|)
for the storage class |C|:

<p algorithm="structure member minimum alignment">
    [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, |M|) = |k| &times; [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, C)<br>
    Where |k| is a positive integer and |M| is a member of structure |S| with type |T|
</p>

Arrays of element type |T| must have an [=element stride=] that is a
multiple of the [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) for the storage class |C|:

<p algorithm="array element minimum alignment">
    [=StrideOf=](array<|T|[, |N|]>) = |k| &times; [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, C)<br>
    Where |k| is a positive integer
</p>

Note: [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) does not impose any additional restrictions
on the values permitted for an [=align=] decoration, nor does it affect the rules
of [=AlignOf=](|T|). Data is laid out with the rules defined in previous
sections and then the resulting layout is validated against the
[=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) rules.

The [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class also requires that:
* Array elements are aligned to 16 byte boundaries.
    That is, [=StrideOf=](array&lt;|T|,|N|&gt;) = 16 &times; |k|' for some positive integer |k|'.
* If a structure member itself has a structure type `S`, then the number of
    bytes between the start of that member and the start of any following member
    must be at least [=roundUp=](16, [=SizeOf=](S)).

## Memory View Types ## {#memory-view-types}

In addition to calculating with [=plain types|plain=] values, a [SHORTNAME] program will
also often read values from memory or write values to memory, via [=memory access=] operations.
Each memory access is performed via a [=memory view=].

A <dfn noexport>memory view</dfn> comprises:
* a set of [=memory locations=] in a particular [=storage class=],
* an interpretation of the contents of those locations as a [SHORTNAME] [=type=], and
* an [=access mode=].

The access mode of a memory view must be supported by the storage class. See [[#storage-class]].

[SHORTNAME] has two kinds of types for representing memory views:
[=reference types=] and [=pointer types=].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Constraint<th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="memory reference type">
    <td style="width:25%">|SC| is a [=storage class=],<br>|T| is a [=storable=] type,<br>|A| is an [=access mode=]
    <td>ref&lt;|SC|,|T|,|A|&gt;
    <td>The <dfn noexport>reference type</dfn>
        identified with the set of [=memory views=] for memory locations in |SC| holding values of type |T|,
        supporting memory accesses described by mode |A|.<br>
        In this context |T| is known as the <dfn noexport>store type</dfn>.<br>
        Reference types are not written in [SHORTNAME] progam source;
        instead they are used to analyze a [SHORTNAME] program.
  <tr algorithm="pointer type">
    <td>|SC| is a [=storage class=],<br>|T| is a [=storable=] type,<br>|A| is an [=access mode=]
    <td>ptr&lt;|SC|,|T|,|A|&gt;
    <td>The <dfn noexport>pointer type</dfn>
        identified with the set of [=memory views=] for memory locations in |SC| holding values of type |T|,
        supporting memory accesses described by mode |A|.<br>
        In this context |T| is known as the <dfn noexport>pointee type</dfn>.<br>
        Pointer types may appear in [SHORTNAME] progam source.
</table>

When *analyzing* a [SHORTNAME] program, reference and pointer types are fully parameterized by a storage class,
a storable type, and an access mode.
In code examples in this specification, the comments show this fully parameterized form.

However, in [SHORTNAME] *source* text:
* Reference types must not appear.
* Pointer types may appear.  A pointer type is spelled with parameterization by:
    * storage class,
    * store type, and
    * sometimes by access mode, as specified in [[#access-mode-defaults]].

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Pointer type'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn my_function(
      // 'ptr<function,i32,read_write>' is the type of a pointer value that references
      // storage for keeping an 'i32' value, using memory locations in the 'function'
      // storage class.  Here 'i32' is the pointee type.
      // The implied access mode is 'read_write'. See below for access mode defaults.
      ptr_int: ptr<function,i32>,

      // 'ptr<private,array<f32,50>,read_write>' is the type of a pointer value that
      // refers to storage for keeping an array of 50 elements of type 'f32', using
      // memory locations in the 'private' storage class.
      // Here the pointee type is 'array<f32,50>'.
      // The implied access mode is 'read_write'. See below for access mode defaults.
      ptr_array: ptr<private, array<f32, 50>>
    ) { }
  </xmp>
</div>

Reference types and pointer types are both sets of memory views:
a particular memory view is associated with a unique reference value and also a unique pointer value:

<blockquote algorithm="pointer reference correspondence">
Each pointer value |p| of type ptr&lt;|SC|,|T|,|A|&gt; corresponds to a unique reference value |r| of type ref&lt;|SC|,|T|,|A|&gt;,
and vice versa,
where |p| and |r| describe the same memory view.
</blockquote>

### Access Mode Defaults ### {#access-mode-defaults}

The access mode for a memory view is often determined by context:

* The [=storage classes/storage=] storage class supports both [=read=] and [=read_write=] access modes.
* Each other storage class supports only one access mode, as described in the <a href="#storage-class-table">storage class</a> table.

When writing a [=variable declaration=] or a [=pointer type=] in [SHORTNAME] source:
* For the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class, the access mode is optional, and defaults to [=access/read=].
* For other storage classes, the access mode must not be written.

### Originating variable ### {#originating-variable-section}

In [SHORTNAME] a reference value always corresponds to the memory view
for some or all of the memory locations for some variable.
This defines the <dfn noexport>originating variable</dfn> for the reference value.

A pointer value always corresponds to a reference value, and so the originating variable
of a pointer is the same as the originating variable of the corresponding reference.

Note: The originating variable is a dynamic concept.
The originating variable for a formal parameter of a function depends on the
[=call site|call sites=] for the function.
Different call sites may supply pointers into different originating variables.

If a reference or pointer access is out of bounds, an <dfn noexport>invalid
memory reference</dfn> is produced.
[=Load Rule|Loads=] from an invalid reference return one of:
    * a value from any [=memory locations|memory location(s)=] of the [[WebGPU#buffers|WebGPU buffer]]
        bound to the [=originating variable=]
    * the [=zero value=] for store type of the reference
    * if the loaded value is a vector, the value (0, 0, 0, x), where x is:
        * 0, 1, or the maximum positive value for integer components
        * 0.0 or 1.0 for floating-point components
[=assignment statement|Stores=] to an invalid reference may either:
    * store the value to any [=memory locations|memory location(s)=] of the
        [[WebGPU#buffers|WebGPU buffer]] bound to the [=originating variable=]
    * not be executed
[[#atomic-rmw|Read-modify-write atomics]] that operate on an invalid memory
reference must load and store from the same [=memory locations|memory
locations=] if they access memory.

### Use cases for references and pointers ### {#ref-ptr-use-cases}

References and pointers are distinguished by how they are used:

* The type of a [=variable=] is a reference type.
* The [=address-of=] operation (unary `&`) converts a reference value to its corresponding pointer value.
* The [=indirection=] operation (unary `*`) converts a pointer value to its corresponding reference value.
* A [=let declaration=] can be of pointer type, but not of reference type.
* A [=formal parameter=] can be of pointer type, but not of reference type.
* An [=assignment statement=] performs a [=write access=] to update the contents of memory via a reference, where:
    * The left-hand side of the assignment statement must be of reference type, with access mode [=write=] or [=read_write=].
    * The right-hand side of the assignment statement must evaluate to the store type of the left-hand side.
* The <dfn noexport>Load Rule</dfn>: Inside a function, a reference is automatically dereferenced (read from) to satisfy type rules:
    * In a function, when a reference expression |r| with store type |T| is used in a statement or an expression, where
    * |r| has an access mode of [=read=] or [=read_write=], and
    * The only potentially matching type rules require |r| to have a value of type |T|, then
    * That type rule requirement is considered to have been met, and
    * The result of evaluating |r| in that context is the value (of type |T|) stored in the memory locations
        referenced by |r| at the time of evaluation.
        That is, a [=read access=] is performed to produce the result value.

Defining references in this way enables simple idiomatic use of variables:

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Reference types enable simple use of variables'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    [[stage(compute)]]
    fn main() {
      // 'i' has reference type ref<function,i32,read_write>
      // The memory locations for 'i' store the i32 value 0.
      var i: i32 = 0;

      // 'i + 1' can only match a type rule where the 'i' subexpression is of type i32.
      // So the expression 'i + 1' has type i32, and at evaluation, the 'i' subexpression
      // evaluates to the i32 value stored in the memory locations for 'i' at the time
      // of evaluation.
      let one: i32 = i + 1;

      // Update the value in the locations referenced by 'i' so they hold the value 2.
      i = one + 1;

      // Update the value in the locations referenced by 'i' so they hold the value 5.
      // The evaluation of the right-hand-side occurs before the assignment takes effect.
      i = i + 3;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Returning a reference returns the value loaded via the reference'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var<private> age: i32;
    fn get_age() -> i32 {
      // The type of the expression in the return statement must be 'i32' since it
      // must match the declared return type of the function.
      // The 'age' expression is of type ref<private,i32,read_write>.
      // Apply the Load Rule, since the store type of the reference matches the
      // required type of the expression, and no other type rule applies.
      // The evaluation of 'age' in this context is the i32 value loaded from the
      // memory locations referenced by 'age' at the time the return statement is
      // executed.
      return age;
    }

    fn caller() {
      age = 21;
      // The copy_age constant will get the i32 value 21.
      let copy_age: i32 = get_age();
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

Defining pointers in this way enables two key use cases:

* Using a let declaration with pointer type, to form a short name for part of the contents of a variable.
* Using a formal parameter of a function to refer to the storage of a variable that is accessible to the calling function.
    * The call to such a function must supply a pointer value for that operand.
        This often requires using an [=address-of=] operation (unary `&`) to get a pointer to the variable's contents.

Note: The following examples use [SHORTNAME] features explained later in this specification.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Using a pointer as a short name for part of a variable'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct Particle {
      position: vec3<f32>;
      velocity: vec3<f32>;
    };

      timestep: f32;
      particles: array<Particle,100>;
    };
    [[group(0), binding(0)]] var<storage,read_write> system: System;

    [[stage(compute)]]
    fn main() {
      // Form a pointer to a specific Particle in storage memory.
      let active_particle: ptr<storage,Particle> =
          &system.particles[system.active_index];

      let delta_position: vec3<f32> = (*active_particle).velocity * system.timestep;
      let current_position: vec3<f32>  = (*active_particle).position;
      (*active_particle).position = delta_position + current_position;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Using a pointer as a formal parameter'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>

      // Update the locations for 'x' to contain the next higher integer value,
      // (or to wrap around to the largest negative i32 value).
      // On the left-hand side, unary '*' converts the pointer to a reference that
      // can then be assigned to. It has a read_write access mode, by default.
      // On the right-hand side:
      //    - Unary '*' converts the pointer to a reference, with a read_write
      //      access mode.
      //    - The only matching type rule is for addition (+) and requires '*x' to
      //      have type i32, which is the store type for '*x'.  So the Load Rule
      //      applies and '*x' evaluates to the value stored in the memory for '*x'
      //      at the time of evaluation, which is the i32 value for 0.
      //    - Add 1 to 0, to produce a final value of 1 for the right-hand side.
      // Store 1 into the memory for '*x'.
      *x = *x + 1;
    }

    [[stage(compute)]]
    fn main() {
      var i: i32 = 0;

      // Modify the contents of 'i' so it will contain 1.
      // Use unary '&' to get a pointer value for 'i'.
      // This is a clear signal that the called function has access to the storage
      // for 'i', and may modify it.
      add_one(&i);
      let one: i32 = i;  // 'one' has value 1.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Forming reference and pointer values ### {#forming-references-and-pointers}

A reference value is formed in one of the following ways:

* The [=identifier=] [=resolves|resolving=] to an [=in scope|in-scope=] variable *v* denotes the reference value for *v*'s storage.
    * The resolved variable is the [=originating variable=] for the reference.
* Use the [=indirection=] (unary `*`) operation on a pointer.
    * The originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the pointer.
* Use a <dfn noexport>composite reference component expression</dfn>.
    In each case the originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the
    original reference.
    * Given a reference with a vector store type, appending a single-letter vector access phrase
        results in a reference to the named component of the vector.
        See [[#component-reference-from-vector-reference]].
    * Given a reference with a vector store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed component of the vector.
        See [[#component-reference-from-vector-reference]].
    * Given a reference with a matrix store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed column vector of the matrix.
        See [[#matrix-access-expr]].
    * Given a reference with an array store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed element of the array.
        See [[#array-access-expr]].
    * Given a reference with a structure store type, appending a member access phrase
        results in a reference to the named member of the structure.
        See [[#struct-access-expr]].

In all cases, the access mode of the result is the same as the access mode of the original reference.

        // The let declaration requires the right-hand-side to be of type f32.
        // The Load Rule applies (because no other type rule can apply), and
        // the evaluation of the initializer yields the f32 value loaded from
        // the memory locations referenced by 'person.weight' at the time the
        // declaration is executed.
        let person_weight: f32 = person.weight;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

A pointer value is formed in one of the following ways:

* Use the [=address-of=] (unary '&') operator on a reference.
    * The originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the reference.
* If a function [=formal parameter=] has pointer type, then when the function is invoked
    at runtime the uses of the formal parameter denote the pointer value
    provided to the corresponding operand at the [=call site=] in the calling function.
    * The originating variable of the formal parameter (at runtime) is defined as
        the originating variable of the pointer operand at the call site.

In all cases, the access mode of the result is the same as the access mode of the original pointer.

### Comparison with references and pointers in other languages ### {#pointers-other-languages}

This section is informative, not normative.

References and pointers in [SHORTNAME] are more restricted than in other languages.
In particular:

* In [SHORTNAME] a reference can't directly be declared as an alias to another reference or variable,
    either as a variable or as a formal parameter.
* In [SHORTNAME] pointers and references are not [=storable=].
    That is, the content of a [SHORTNAME] variable may not contain a pointer or a reference.
* In [SHORTNAME] a function must not return a pointer or reference.
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to convert between integer values and pointer values.
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to forcibly change the type of a pointer value into another pointer type.
    * A composite component reference expression is different:
        it takes a reference to a composite value and yields a reference to
        one of the components or elements inside the composite value.
        These are considered different references in [SHORTNAME], even though they may
        have the same machine address at a lower level of implementation abstraction.
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to forcibly change the type of a reference value into another reference type.
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to change the access mode of a pointer or reference.
    * By comparison, C++ automatically converts a non-const pointer to a const pointer,
        and has a `const_cast` to convert a const value to a non-const value.
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to allocate new storage from a "heap".
* In [SHORTNAME] there is no way to explicitly destroy a variable.
    The storage for a [SHORTNAME] variable becomes inaccessible only when the variable goes out of scope.

Note: From the above rules, it is not possible to form a "dangling" pointer,
i.e. a pointer that does not reference the storage for a valid (or "live")
originating variable.

## Texture and Sampler Types ## {#texture-types}

A <dfn noexport>texel</dfn> is a scalar or vector used as the smallest independently accessible element of a [=texture=].
The word *texel* is short for *texture element*.

A <dfn noexport>texture</dfn> is a collection of texels supporting special operations useful for rendering.
In [SHORTNAME], those operations are invoked via texture builtin functions.
See [[#texture-builtin-functions]] for a complete list.

A [SHORTNAME] texture corresponds to a [[WebGPU#gputexture|WebGPU GPUTexture]].

A texture is either arrayed, or non-arrayed:

* A <dfn noexport>non-arrayed texture</dfn> is a grid of texels. Each texel has a unique grid coordinate.
* An <dfn noexport>arrayed texture</dfn> is a homegeneous array of grids of texels.
    In an arrayed texture, each texel is identified with its unique combination of array index and grid coordinate.

A texture has the following features:

: texel format
:: The data in each texel. See [[#texel-formats]]
:  dimensionality
:: The number of dimensions in the grid coordinates, and how the coordinates are interpreted.
    The number of dimensions is 1, 2, or 3.
    Most textures use cartesian coordinates.
    Cube textures have six square faces, and are sampled with
    a three dimensional coordinate interpreted as a direction vector from the origin toward
    the cube centered on the orgin.
: size
:: The extent of grid coordinates along each dimension
: mip level count
:: The mip level count is at least 1 for sampled textures, and equal to 1 for storage textures.<br>
    Mip level 0 contains a full size version of the texture.
    Each successive mip level contains a filtered version of the previous mip level
    at half the size (within rounding) of the previous mip level.<br>
    When sampling a texture, an explicit or implicitly-computed level-of-detail is used
    to select the mip levels from which to read texel data.  These are then combined via
    filtering to produce the sampled value.
: arrayed
:: whether the texture is arrayed
: <dfn noexport>array size</dfn>
:: the number of homogeneous grids, if the texture is arrayed

A texture's representation is typically optimized for rendering operations.
To achieve this, many details are hidden from the programmer, including data layouts, data types, and
internal operations that cannot be expressed directly in the shader language.

As a consequence, a shader does not have direct access to the texel storage within a texture variable.
Instead, access is mediated through an opaque handle:

* Within the shader:
    * Declare a module-scope variable
        where the [=store type=] is one of the texture types described in later sections.
        The variable stores an opaque handle to the underlying texture memory, and is
        automatically placed in the [=storage classes/handle=] storage class.
    * Inside a function, call one of the texture builtin functions, and provide
        the texture variable as the first parameter.
* When constructing the WebGPU pipeline, the texture variable's store type and binding
    must be compatible with the corresponding bind group layout entry.

TODO: update this wording to handle function parameters that are textures or samplers.

In this way, the set of supported operations for a texture type
is determined by the availability of texture builtin functions accepting that texture type
as the first parameter.

Note: The handle stored by a texture variable cannot be changed by the shader.
That is, the variable is read-only, even if the underlying texture to which it provides
access may be mutable (e.g. a write-only storage texture).

TODO: Describe the use of samplers, in the same broad framework.

### Texel formats ### {#texel-formats}

In [SHORTNAME], certain texture types are parameterized by texel format.

A <dfn noexport>texel format</dfn> is characterized by:

: <dfn noexport>channels</dfn>
:: Each channel contains a scalar.
    A texel format has up to four channels: `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a`,
    normally corresponding to the concepts of red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
: <dfn noexport>channel format</dfn>
:: The number of bits in the channel, and how those bits are interpreted.

Each texel format in [SHORTNAME] corresponds to a [[WebGPU#enumdef-gputextureformat|WebGPU GPUTextureFormat]]
with the same name.

Only certain texel formats are used in [SHORTNAME] source code.
The channel formats used to define those texel formats are listed in the
<dfn dfn>Channel Formats</dfn> table.
The last column specfies the conversion from the stored channel bits to the value used in the shader.
This is also known as the <dfn noexport>channel transfer function</dfn>, or CTF.

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Channel Formats</caption>

  <tr><td>32float<td>32<td>[[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary32 32-bit floating point value |v|<td>f32<td>|v|
</table>

The texel formats listed in the
<dfn dfn lt="storage-texel-formats">Texel Formats for Storage Textures</dfn> table
correspond to the [[WebGPU#plain-color-formats|WebGPU plain color formats]]
which support the [[WebGPU#dom-gputextureusage-storage|WebGPU STORAGE]] usage.
These texel formats are used to parameterize the storage texture types defined
in [[#texture-storage]].

When the texel format does not have all four channels, then:

* When reading the texel:
    * If the texel format has no green channel, then the second component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no blue channel, then the third component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no alpha channel, then the fourth component of the shader value is 1.
* When writing the texel, shader value components for missing channels are ignored.

The last column in the table below uses the format-specific
[=channel transfer function=] from the [=channel formats=] table.

</pre>
* type must be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`
* The parameterized type for the images is the type after conversion from sampling.
    E.g. you can have an image with texels with 8bit unorm components, but when you sample
    them you get a 32-bit float result (or vec-of-f32).

### Multisampled Texture Types ### {#multisampled-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_multisampled_2d<type>`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %type 2D 0 0 1 1 Unknown
</pre>
* type must be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`

### External Sampled Texture Types ### {#external-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_external`
</pre>

`texture_external` is an opaque 2d float-sampled texture type similar to `texture_2d<f32>`
but potentially with a different representation.
It can be read using `textureLoad` or `textureSampleLevel`,
which handle these different representations opaquely.

See [`GPUExternalTexture`](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#gpu-external-texture) for details.

### Storage Texture Types ### {#texture-storage}

A <dfn noexport>storage texture</dfn> supports accessing a single texel without the use of a sampler.

* A <dfn noexport>write-only storage texture</dfn>
     supports writing a single texel, with automatic conversion of the shader value to a
     stored texel value.

A storage texture type must be parameterized by one of the
[=storage-texel-format|texel formats for storage textures=].
The texel format determines the conversion function as specified in [[#texel-formats]].

For a write-only storage texture the *inverse* of the conversion function is used to convert the shader value to
the stored texel.

See [[#texture-builtin-functions]].

TODO(dneto): Move description of the conversion to the builtin function that actually does the reading.

<pre class='def'>
`texture_storage_1d<texel_format,access>`
  // %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 1D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_2d<texel_format,access>`
  // %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 2D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_2d_array<texel_format,access>`
  // %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 2D 0 1 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_3d<texel_format,access>`
  // %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 3D 0 0 0 2 image_format
</pre>

* `texel_format` must be one of the texel types specified in [=storage-texel-formats=]
* `access` must be [=access/write=].

In the SPIR-V mapping:
* The *Image Format* parameter of the image type declaration is
    as specified by the SPIR-V texel format correspondence table in [[#texel-formats]].
* The *Sampled Type* parameter of the image type declaration is
    the SPIR-V scalar type corresponding to the channel format for the texel format.

When mapping to SPIR-V, a write-only storage texture variable must have a `NonReadable` decoration.

For example:

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Mapping a writable texture_storage_1d variable to SPIR-V'>
  <xmp>
      var tbuf: texture_storage_1d<rgba8unorm,write>;

      // Maps to the following SPIR-V:
      //  OpDecorate %tbuf NonReadable
      //  ...
      //  %float = OpTypeFloat 32
      //  %image_type = OpTypeImage %float 1D 0 0 0 2 Rgba8
      //  %image_ptr_type = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %image_type
      //  %tbuf = OpVariable %image_ptr_type UniformConstant
  </xmp>
</div>

### Depth Texture Types ### {#texture-depth}
<pre class='def'>
`texture_depth_2d`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %f32 2D 1 0 0 1 Unknown

`texture_depth_2d_array`

`texture_depth_cube`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %f32 Cube 1 0 0 1 Unknown

  %1 = OpTypeImage %f32 Cube 1 1 0 1 Unknown

`texture_depth_multisampled_2d`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %f32 2D 1 0 1 1 Unknown
</pre>

### Sampler Type ### {#sampler-type}

A <dfn>sampler</dfn> mediates access to a sampled texture or a depth texture, by performing a combination of:
* coordinate transformation.
* optionally modifying mip-level selection.
* for a sampled texture, optionally filtering retrieved texel values.
* for a depth texture, determining the comparison function applied to the retrieved texel.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description

</table>

Samplers are parameterized when created in the WebGPU API.
They cannot be modified by a [SHORTNAME] program.

Samplers can only be used by the [[#texture-builtin-functions|texture builtin functions]].

# `var` and `let` # {#var-and-let}

A <dfn noexport>let declaration</dfn> specifies a name for a value.
Once the value for a let-declaration is computed, it is immutable.
When an [=identifier=] use [=resolves=] to a let-declaration, the identifier denotes that value.

When a `let` identifier is declared without an explicitly specified type,
e.g. `let foo = 4`, the type is automatically inferred from the expression to the right of the equals token (`=`).
When the type is specified, e.g `let foo: i32 = 4`, the initializer expression must evaluate to that type.

Some rules about `let`-declarations depend on where the declaration appears.
See [[#module-constants]] and [[#function-scope-variables]].

<div class='example let declaration at module-scope' heading='let-declared constants at module scope'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // 'blockSize' denotes the i32 value 1024.
    let blockSize: i32 = 1024;

    // 'row_size' denotes the u32 value 16u.  The type is inferred.
    let row_size = 16u;
  </xmp>
</div>

A <dfn dfn noexport>variable</dfn> is a named reference to storage that can contain a value of a
particular [=storable=] type.

Two types are associated with a variable: its [=store type=] (the type of value
that may be placed in the referenced storage) and its [=reference type=] (the type
of the variable itself).
If a variable has store type *T* and [=storage class=] *S*,
then its reference type is ref&lt;*S*,*T*&gt;.

A <dfn dfn noexport>variable declaration</dfn>:

* Specifies the variable’s name.
* Specifies the [=storage class=], [=store type=], and [=access mode=].
    Together these comprise the variable's [=reference type=].
* Ensures the execution environment allocates storage for a value of the store type,
    supporting the given access mode, for the [=lifetime=] of the variable.
* Optionally has an *initializer* expression, if the variable is in the [=storage classes/private=] or [=storage classes/function=] storage classes.
    If present, the initializer expression must evaluate to the variable's store type.

When an [=identifier=] use [=resolves=] to a variable declaration,
the identifier is an expression denoting the reference [=memory view=] for the variable's storage,
and its type is the variable's reference type.
See [[#var-identifier-expr]].

See [[#module-scope-variables]] and [[#function-scope-variables]] for rules about where
a variable in a particular storage class can be declared,
and when the storage class decoration is required, optional, or forbidden.

The access mode always has a default, and except for variables in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class,
must not be written. See [[#access-mode-defaults]].

The <dfn noexport>lifetime</dfn> of a variable is the period during shader
execution for which the variable exists.
The lifetime of a [=module scope=] variable is the entire execution of the shader stage.

For a [=function scope=] variable, each invocation has its own independent
version of the variable.
The lifetime of the variable is determined by its scope:
* It begins when control enters the variable's decalaration.
* It includes the entire execution of any function called from within the variable's scope.
* It ends when control leaves the variable's scope, other than calling a function from
    within the variable's scope.

Two variables with overlapping lifetimes will not have overlapping storage.
When a variable's lifetime ends, its storage may be used for another variable.

When a variable is created, its storage contains an initial value as follows:

* For variables in the [=storage classes/private=] or [=storage classes/function=] storage classes:
    * The [=zero value=] for the store type, if the variable declaration has no initializer.
    * Otherwise, it is the result of evaluating the initializer expression at that point in the program execution.
* For variables in other storage classes, the execution environment provides the initial value.

Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
<div class='example wsgl function-scope' heading='Variable initial values'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var i: i32;         // Initial value is 0.  Not recommended style.
    loop {
      var twice: i32 = 2 * i;   // Re-evaluated each iteration.
      i = i + 1;
      if (i == 5) { break; }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
The loop body will execute five times.
Variable `i` will take on values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and variable `twice` will take on values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
<div class='example wsgl function-scope' heading='Reading a variable multiple times'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var x: f32 = 1.0;
    let y = x * x + x + 1;
  </xmp>
</div>
Because `x` is a variable, all accesses to it turn into load and store operations.
If this snippet was compiled to SPIR-V, it would be represented as
<div class='example spirv' heading='Sample translation for reading a variable multiple times'>
  <xmp highlight='asm'>
    %temp_1 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_2 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_3 = OpFMul %float %temp_1 %temp_2
    %temp_4 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_5 = OpFAdd %float %temp_3 %temp_4
    %y      = OpFAdd %float %temp_5 %one
  </xmp>
</div>
However, it is expected that either the browser or the driver optimizes this intermediate representation
such that the redundant loads are eliminated.

## Module Scope Variables ## {#module-scope-variables}

A variable declared outside all functions is at [=module scope=].
The variable name is available for use immediately after its declaration statement, until the end
of the program.

Variables at [=module scope=] are restricted as follows:

* The variable must not be in the [=storage classes/function=] storage class.
* A variable in the [=storage classes/private=], [=storage classes/workgroup=], [=storage classes/uniform=], or [=storage classes/storage=] storage classes:
    * Must be declared with an explicit storage class decoration.
    * Must use a [=store type=] as described in [[#storage-class]].
* If the [=store type=] is a texture type or a sampler type, then the variable declaration must not
    have a storage class decoration.  The storage class will always be [=storage classes/handle=].

A variable in the [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class is a <dfn noexport>uniform buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] structure type with [=attribute/block=] attribute,
satisfying the [storage class layout constraints](#storage-class-layout-constraints).

A variable in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class is a <dfn noexport>storage buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] structure type with [=attribute/block=] attribute,
satisfying the [storage class layout constraints](#storage-class-layout-constraints).
It may be declared with a [=access/read=] or [=access/read_write=] access mode; the default is [=access/read=].

As described in [[#resource-interface]],
uniform buffers, storage buffers, textures, and samplers form the
[=resource interface of a shader=].
Such variables are declared with [=attribute/group=] and [=attribute/binding=] decorations.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Module scope variable declarations">
  <xmp>
    var<private> decibels: f32;
    var<workgroup> worklist: array<i32,10>;

    [[block]] struct Params {
      specular: f32;
      count: i32;
    };
    [[group(0), binding(2)]]
    var<uniform> param: Params;    // A uniform buffer

    [[block]] struct PositionsBuffer {
      pos: array<vec2<f32>>;
    };
    // A storage buffer, for reading and writing
    [[group(0), binding(0)]]
    var<storage,read_write> pbuf: PositionsBuffer;

    // Textures and samplers are always in "handle" storage.
    [[group(0), binding(1)]]
    var filter_params: sampler;
  </xmp>
</div>

  </xmp>
</div>

[SHORTNAME] defines the following attributes that can be applied to global variables:
 * [=attribute/binding=]
 * [=attribute/group=]

## Module Constants ## {#module-constants}

A `let`-declaration appearing outside all functions declares a
[=module scope|module-scope=] constant.
The name is available for use after the end of the declaration,
until the end of the [SHORTNAME] program.

A module-scope let-declared constant must be of [=constructible=] type.

When the declaration has no attributes, an initializer expression must be present,
and the name denotes the value of that expression.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Module constants'>
  <xmp>
    // The golden ratio.
    let golden: f32 = 1.61803398875;

    // The second unit vector for three dimensions, with inferred type.
    let e2 = vec3<i32>(0,1,0);
  </xmp>
</div>

When the declaration uses the [=override=] attribute,
the constant is <dfn noexport>pipeline-overridable</dfn>. In this case:

  * The type must be one of the [=scalar=] types.
  * The initializer expression is optional.
  * The attribute's literal operand, if present, is known as the <dfn noexport>pipeline constant ID</dfn>,
    and must be an integer value between 0 and 65535.
  * Pipeline constant IDs must be unique within the [SHORTNAME] program: Two module constants
    must not use the same pipeline constant ID.
  * The application can specify its own value for the constant at pipeline-creation time.
    The pipeline creation API accepts a mapping from overridable constant to a
    value of the constant's type.
    The constant is identified by a <dfn export>pipeline-overridable constant identifier string</dfn>,
    which is the base-10 representation of the [=pipeline constant ID=] if specified, and otherwise
    the declared [=name=] of the constant.
  * The <dfn export>pipeline-overridable constant has a default value</dfn> if
    its declaration has an initializer expression.
    If it doesn't, a value must be provided at pipeline-creation time.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Module constants, pipeline-overrideable'>
  <xmp>
    [[override(0)]]    let has_point_light: bool = true;  // Algorithmic control
    [[override(1200)]] let specular_param: f32 = 2.3;     // Numeric control
    [[override(1300)]] let gain: f32;                     // Must be overridden
    [[override]]       let width: f32 = 0.0;              // Specifed at the API level using
                                                          // the name "width".
    [[override]]       let depth: f32;                    // Specifed at the API level using
                                                          // the name "depth".
                                                          // Must be overridden.
  </xmp>
</div>

When a variable or feature is used within control flow that depends on the
value of a constant, then that variable or feature is considered to be used by the
program.
This is true regardless of the value of the constant, whether that value
is the one from the constant's declaration or from a pipeline override.

Issue(dneto): The WebGPU pipeline creation API must specify how API-supplied values are mapped to
shader scalar values.  For booleans, I suggest using a 32-bit integer, where only 0 maps to `false`.
If [SHORTNAME] gains non-32-bit numeric scalars, I recommend overridable constants continue being 32-bit
numeric types.

## Function Scope Variables and Constants ## {#function-scope-variables}

A variable or constant declared in a declaration statement in a function body is in <dfn noexport>function scope</dfn>.
The name is available for use immediately after its declaration statement,
and until the end of the brace-delimited list of statements immediately enclosing the declaration.

A function-scope let-declared constant must be of [=constructible=] type, or of [=pointer type=].

For a variable declared in function scope:
* The variable is always in the [=storage classes/function=] storage class.
* The storage decoration is optional.
* The [=store type=] must be a [=constructible=] type.
* When an initializer is specified, the store type may be omitted from the declaration.
    In this case the store type is the type of the result of evaluating the initializer.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Function scope variables and constants">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn f() {
       var<function> count: u32;  // A variable in function storage class.
       var delta: i32;            // Another variable in the function storage class.
       var sum: f32 = 0.0;        // A function storage class variable with initializer.
       var pi = 3.14159;          // Infer the f32 store type from the initializer.
       let unit: i32 = 1;         // Let-declared constants don't use a storage class.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

A variable or constant declared in the first clause of a `for` statement is available for use in the second
and third clauses and in the body of the `for` statement.

An instance of a function scope variable is a [=dynamic context=].
Each variable that is [=in scope=] for some invocation has an overlapping
[=lifetime=] and, therefore, has non-overlapping storage.
Variables with non-overlapping lifetimes may reuse the storage of previous
variables; however, new instances of the same variable are not guaranteed to
use the same storage.

## Zero Value Expressions ## {#zero-value-expr}

Each [=constructible=] *T* has a unique <dfn noexport>zero value</dfn>
written in WGSL as the type followed by an empty pair of parentheses: *T* `()`.

The zero values are as follows:

* `bool()` is `false`
* `i32()` is 0
* `u32()` is 0
* `f32()` is 0.0
* The zero value for an *N*-element vector of type *T* is the *N*-element vector of the zero value for *T*.
* The zero value for an *N*-column *M*-row matrix of `f32` is the matrix of those dimensions filled with 0.0 entries.
* The zero value for an *N*-element array with [=constructible=] element type *E* is an array of *N* elements of the zero value for *E*.
* The zero value for a [=constructible=] structure type *S* is the structure value *S* with zero-valued members.

Note: WGSL does not have zero expression for [=atomic types=],
[=runtime-sized=] arrays, or other types that are not [=constructible=].

## Reinterpretation of Representation Expressions ## {#bitcast-expr}

value in one type as a value in another type.

## Composite Value Decomposition Expressions ## {#composite-value-decomposition-expr}

### Vector Access Expression ### {#vector-access-expr}

Accessing members of a vector can be done either using array subscripting (e.g. `a[2]`) or using a sequence of convenience names, each mapping to an element of the source vector.

<ul>
  <li>The colour set of convenience names: `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` for vector elements 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
  <li>The dimensional set of convenience names: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` for vector elements 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
</ul>

The convenience names are accessed using the `.` notation. (e.g. `color.bgra`).

NOTE: the convenience letterings can not be mixed. (i.e. you can not use `rybw`).

Using a convenience letter, or array subscript, which accesses an element past the end of the vector is an error.

The convenience letterings can be applied in any order, including duplicating letters as needed. You can provide 1 to 4 letters when extracting components from a vector. Providing more then 4 letters is an error.

The result type depends on the number of letters provided. Assuming a `vec4<f32>`

Note: Reflecting the limitations of the languages WGSL is meant to be translated
into, it is only possible to use dynamically computed indices to subscript
references to matrices. A matrix not behind a reference may only be indexed by a
`const_expression`. To work around this restriction, consider storing the matrix in a
temporary variable, and then subscripting the variable: a
[[#var-identifier-expr|variable identifier expression]] produces a reference to
the variable's value, as required.

## Assignment Statement ## {#assignment}

An <dfn noexport>assignment statement</dfn> replaces the contents of a variable,
or a portion of a variable, with a new value.

The
expression to the left of the equals token is the <dfn noexport>left-hand side</dfn>,
and the
expression to the right of the equals token is the <dfn noexport>right-hand side</dfn>.

else_statement
  : ELSE compound_statement
</pre>

An <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">if</dfn> statement conditionally executes at most one [=compound statement=] based on
the evaluation of the condition expressions.

The `if` statements in [SHORTNAME] use an if/elseif/else structure, that contains a single required
`if` clause, zero or more `elseif` clauses and a single optional `else` clause.
Each of the expressions for the `if` and `elseif` clause conditions must be a scalar boolean expression.

An `if` statement is executed as follows:
* The condition associated with the `if` clause is evaluated.
    If the result is `true`,
    control transfers to the first compound statement (immediately after the parenthesized condition experession).
* Otherwise, the condition of the next `elseif` clause in textual order (if one exists) is evaluated
     and, if the result is `true`, control transfers to the associated compound statement.
     * This behavior is repeated for all `elseif` clauses until one of the conditions evaluates to `true`.
* If no condition evaluates to `true`, then control transfers to the compound statement
    associated with the `else` clause (if it exists).

### Switch Statement ### {#switch-statement}

case_selectors
  : const_literal (COMMA const_literal)* COMMA?

case_body
  :
  | statement case_body
  | FALLTHROUGH SEMICOLON
</pre>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">switch</dfn> statement transfers control to one of a set of case clauses, or to the `default` clause,
depending on the evaluation of a selector expression.

The selector expression must be of a scalar integer type.
If the selector value equals a value in a case selector list, then control is transferred to
the body of that case clause.
If the selector value does not equal any of the case selector values, then control is
transferred to the `default` clause.

Each switch statement must have exactly one default clause.

The case selector values must have the same type as the result of evaluating the selector expression.

A literal value must not appear more than once in the case selectors for a switch statement.

Note: The value of the literal is what matters, not the spelling.
For example `0`, `00`, and `0x0000` all denote the zero value.

When control reaches the end of a case body, control normally transfers to the first statement
after the switch statement.
Alternately, executing a <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">fallthrough</dfn> statement
transfers control to the body of the next case clause or
default clause, whichever appears next in the switch body.
A `fallthrough` statement must not appear as the last statement in the last clause of a switch.
When a [=declaration=] appears in a case body, its [=identifier=] is [=in scope=] from
the start of the next statement until the end of the case body.

Note: Identifiers declared in a case body are not [=in scope=] of case bodies
which are reachable via a `fallthrough` statement.


### Loop Statement ### {#loop-statement}

<pre class='def'>
loop_statement
  : LOOP BRACE_LEFT statements? continuing_statement? BRACE_RIGHT
</pre>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">loop</dfn> statement repeatedly executes a <dfn noexport>loop body</dfn>;
the loop body is specified as a [=compound statement=].
Each execution of the loop body is called an <dfn noexport>iteration</dfn>.

The [=identifier=] of a [=declaration=] in a loop is [=in scope=] from the start of the
next statement until the end of the loop body.
The declaration is executed each time it is reached, so each new iteration
creates a new instance of the variable or constant, and re-initializes it.

This repetition can be interrupted by a [=break=], [=return=], or
[=statement/discard=] statement.

Optionally, the last statement in the loop body may be a
[=continuing=] statement.

Note: The loop statement is one of the biggest differences from other shader
languages.

This design directly expresses loop idioms commonly found in compiled code.
In particular, placing the loop update statements at the end of the loop body
allows them to naturally use values defined in the loop body.

</pre>

The <dfn dfn-for="statement">for</dfn> statement takes the form
`for(initializer; condition; continuing_part) { body }` and is syntactic sugar on top of a [=loop=] statement with the same `body`.
Additionally:
* If `initializer` is non-empty, it is executed inside an additional scope before the first [=iteration=].
* If `condition` is non-empty, it is checked at the beginning of the loop body and if unsatisfied then a [[#break-statement]] is executed.
* If `continuing_part` is non-empty, it becomes a [=continuing=] statement at the end of the loop body.

The `initializer` of a for loop is executed once prior to executing the loop.
When a [=declaration=] appears in the initializer, its [=identifier=] is [=in scope=] until the end of the `body`.
Unlike declarations in the `body`, the declaration is not re-initialized each iteration.

The `condition`, `body` and `continuing_part` execute in that order to form a loop [=iteration=].
The `body` is a special form of [=compound statement=].
The identifier of a declaration in the `body` is [=in scope=] from the start of
the next statement until the end of the `body`.
The declaration is executed each time it is reached, so each new iteration
creates a new instance of the variable or constant, and re-intializes it.

<div class='example glsl' heading="For to Loop transformation">

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">break</dfn> statement transfers control to the first statement

A `break` statement must only be used within [=loop=], [=for=], and [=switch=] statements.

When a `break` statement is placed such that it would exit from a loop's [=continuing=] statement,
then:

* The `break` statement must appear as either:
    * The only statement in the `if` clause of an `if` statement that has:
        * no `else` clause or an empty `else` clause
        * no `elseif` clauses
    * The only statement in the `else` clause of an `if` statement that has an empty `if` clause and no `elseif` clauses.
* That `if` statement must appear last in the `continuing` clause.

### Continue Statement ### {#continue-statement}

<pre class='def'>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">continue</dfn> statement transfers control in the nearest-enclosing [=loop=]:

*  forward to the [=continuing=] statement at the end of the body of that loop, if it exists.
*  otherwise backward to the first statement in the loop body, starting the next [=iteration=].

A `continue` statement must only be used in a [=loop=] or [=for=] statement.
A `continue` statement must not be placed such that it would transfer
control to an enclosing [=continuing=] statement.
(It is a *forward* branch when branching to a `continuing` statement.)

A `continue` statement must not be placed such that it would transfer
control past a declaration used in the targeted [=continuing=] statement.

### Continuing Statement ### {#continuing-statement}

<pre class='def'>
continuing_statement
  : CONTINUING compound_statement
</pre>

A <dfn dfn-for="statement">continuing</dfn> statement specifies a [=compound statement=] to be executed at the end of a loop [=iteration=].
The construct is optional.

The compound statement must not contain a [=return=] or [=statement/discard=] statement, at any compound statement nesting level.

### Return Statement ### {#return-statement}

<pre class='def'>
return_statement
  : RETURN short_circuit_or_expression?
</pre>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">return</dfn> statement ends execution of the current function.
If the function is an [=entry point=], then the current shader invocation
is terminated.
Otherwise, evaluation continues with the next expression or statement after
the evaluation of the [=call site=] of the current function invocation.

If the function doesn't have a [=return type=], then the [=return=] statement is
optional. If the return statement is provided for such a function, it must not
supply a value.
Otherwise the expression must be present, and is called the *return value*.
In this case the call site of this function invocation evaluates to the return value.
The type of the return value must match the return type of the function.

### Discard Statement ### {#discard-statement}

A <dfn dfn-for="statement">discard</dfn> statement immediately ends execution of a fragment shader invocation and throws away the fragment.
The `discard` statement must only be used in a [=fragment=] shader stage.

More precisely, executing a `discard` statement will:

* immediately terminate the current invocation, and
* prevent evaluation and generation of a return value for the [=entry point=], and
* prevent the current fragment from being processed downstream in the [=GPURenderPipeline=].

Only statements
executed prior to the `discard` statement will have observable effects.

Note: A `discard` statement may be executed by any
[=functions in a shader stage|function in a fragment stage=] and the effect is the same:
immediate termination of the invocation.

After a `discard` statement is executed, control flow is non-uniform for the
duration of the entry point.

Issue: [[#uniform-control-flow]] needs to state whether all invocations being discarded maintains uniform control flow.

<div class='example' heading='Using the discard statement to throw away a fragment'>
  <xmp>
  var<private> will_emit_color: bool = false;

## Function Call Statement ## {#function-call-statement}

<pre class='def'>
func_call_statement
  : IDENT argument_expression_list
</pre>

A function call statement executes a [=function call=] where the called
function does not return a value.
If the called function returns a value, that value must be consumed either
through assignment, evaluation in another expression or through use of the
`ignore` built-in function (see [[#value-steering-functions]]).

# Functions # {#functions}

A <dfn dfn-for="function" noexport>function</dfn> performs computational work when invoked.

A function is invoked in one of the following ways:
* By evaluating a function call expression. See [[#function-call-expr]].
* By executing a function call statement. See [[#function-call-statement]].
* An [=entry point=] function is invoked by the WebGPU implementation to perform
    the work of a [=shader stage=] in a [=pipeline=]. See [[#entry-points]]

There are two kinds of functions:
* A [=built-in function=] is provided by the [SHORTNAME] implementation,
    and is always available to a [SHORTNAME] program.
    See [[#builtin-functions]].
* A <dfn noexport>user-defined function</dfn> is declared in a [SHORTNAME] program.

## Declaring a user-defined function ## {#function-declaration-sec}

A <dfn noexport>function declaration</dfn> creates a user-defined function, by specifying:
* An optional set of attributes.
* The name of the function.
* The formal parameter list: an ordered sequence of zero
    or more [=formal parameter=] declarations,
    separated by commas, and
    surrounded by parentheses.
* An optional, possibly decorated, <dfn noexport>return type</dfn>.
* The <dfn noexport>function body</dfn>.

A function declaration must only occur at [=module scope=].
The function name is [=in scope=] from the start of the formal parameter list
until the end of the program.

A <dfn noexport>formal parameter</dfn> [=declaration=] specifies an [=identifier=] name and a type for a value that must be
provided when invoking the function.
A formal parameter may have attributes.
See [[#function-calls]].
The identifier is [=in scope=] until the end of the function.
Two formal parameters for a given function must not have the same name.

If the return type is specified, then:
* The return type must be [=constructible=].
* The last statement in the function body must be a [=return=] statement.

    }

    }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Function calls ## {#function-calls}

A <dfn noexport>function call</dfn> is a statement or expression which invokes a function.

The function call must supply the same number of argument values as there are
[=formal parameter|formal parameters=] in the called function.
Each argument value must evaluate to the same type as the corresponding formal
parameter, by position.

When a function call is executed the following steps occur:
* Function call argument values are evaluated.
    The relative order of evaluation is not specified.
* Execution of the current function is suspended.
    All [=function scope=] variables and constants maintain their current values.
* Storage is allocated for each function scope variable in the called function.
    * Initialization occurs as described in [[#var-and-let]].
* Values for the formal parameters of the called function are determined
    by matching the function call argument values by position.
    For example, in the body of the called function the first formal parameter will denote
    the value of the first argument at the [=call site=].
* Control is transferred to the first statement in the called function.
* The called function is executed.
* When the called function returns, by either executing a [=return=] statement or reaching
    the end of the called function (if the function does not return a value),
    control is transferred back the calling function, and the called function's execution is
    unsuspended.
    If the called function returns a value, that value is supplied for the
    value of the function call expression.

The location of a function call is referred to as a <dfn noexport>call site</dfn>.
Call sites are a [=dynamic context=].
As such, the same textual location may represent multiple call sites.

Note: There are no default parameter values in [SHORTNAME].
Built-in functions described this way are really overloaded functions.

Note: The current function will not resume execution if the called function or
any descendent called function executes a [=statement/discard=] statement.

## Restrictions on functions ## {#function-restriction}

* Recursion is not permitted.
    That is, there must be no cycles in the call graph.
* A [=vertex=] shader must return the `position` [=built-in output variable|built-in variable=].
    See [[#builtin-variables]].
* An entry point must never be the target of a [=function call=].
* If a function has a return type, it must be a [=constructible=] type.
* A [=formal parameter|function parameter=] must one the following types:
    * a constructible type
    * a pointer type
    * a texture type
    * a sampler type
* Each function call argument must evaluate to the type of the corresponding
    function parameter.
    * In particular, an argument that is a pointer must agree with the formal parameter
        on storage class, pointee type, and access mode.
* For [=user-defined functions=], a parameter of pointer type must be in one of
    the following storage classes:
    * [=storage classes/function=]
    * [=storage classes/private=]
    * [=storage classes/workgroup=]
* For [=built-in functions=], a parameter of pointer type must be in one of
    the following storage classes:
    * [=storage classes/function=]
    * [=storage classes/private=]
    * [=storage classes/workgroup=]
    * [=storage classes/storage=]
* Each argument of pointer type to a [=user-defined function=] must be one of:
    * An [[#address-of-expr|address-of expression]] of a
        [[#var-identifier-expr|variable identifier expression]]
    * A function parameter
* [SHORTNAME] assumes no aliasing is present between any combination of
    function parameters and variables.
    As such, a function parameter of pointer type must not be used to read or
    write to any [=memory locations=] of its [=originating variable=] that are
    also written via:
    * Another function parameter in the same function
    * A statement or expression in the function using the originating variable directly

Note: The aliasing restriction applies to memory location written by function
calls in the function.

Issue: Revisit aliasing rules for clarity.

# Entry Points TODO # {#entry-points}

## Shader Stages ## {#shader-stages-sec}

WebGPU issues work to the GPU in the form of [=draw command|draw=] or [=dispatch commands=].
These commands execute a pipeline in the context of a set of
[=pipeline input|inputs=], [=pipeline output|outputs=], and attached [=resources=].

A <dfn noexport>pipeline</dfn> describes the behaviour to be performed on the GPU, as a sequence
of stages, some of which are programmable.
In WebGPU, a pipeline is created before scheduling a draw or dispatch command for execution.
There are two kinds of pipelines: GPUComputePipeline, and GPURenderPipeline.

A [=dispatch command=] uses a <dfn noexport>GPUComputePipeline</dfn> to run a
<dfn noexport>compute shader stage</dfn> over a logical
grid of points with a controllable amount of parallelism,
while reading and possibly updating buffer and image resources.

A [=draw command=] uses a <dfn noexport>GPURenderPipeline</dfn> to run a multi-stage process with
two programmable stages among other fixed-function stages:

* A <dfn noexport>vertex shader stage</dfn> maps input attributes for a single vertex into
    output attributes for the vertex.
* Fixed-function stages map vertices into graphic primitives (such as triangles)
    which are then rasterized to produce fragments.
* A <dfn noexport>fragment shader stage</dfn> processes each fragment,
    possibly producing a fragment output.
* Fixed-function stages consume a fragment output, possibly updating external state
    such as color attachments and depth and stencil buffers.

The WebGPU specification describes pipelines in greater detail.

[SHORTNAME] defines three <dfn noexport>shader stages</dfn>, corresponding to the
programmable parts of pipelines:

* <dfn noexport>compute</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>vertex</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>fragment</dfn>

Each shader stage has its own set of features and constraints, described elsewhere.

## Entry point declaration ## {#entry-point-decl}

An <dfn noexport>entry point</dfn> is a [=user-defined function=] that is invoked to perform
the work for a particular [=shader stage=].

Specify a `stage` attribute on a [=function declaration=] to declare that function
as an entry point.

When configuring the stage in the pipeline, the entry point is specified by providing
the [SHORTNAME] module and the entry point's function name.

The parameters of an entry point have to be within [=Entry point IO type=]s.
The return type of an entry point has to be of an [=Entry point IO type=], if specified.

Note: compute entry points never have a return type.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Entry Point'>
  <xmp>
    [[stage(vertex)]]
    fn vert_main() -> [[builtin(position)]] vec4<f32> {
      return vec4<f32>(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
       // OpEntryPoint Vertex %vert_main "vert_main" %return_value
       // OpDecorate %return_value BuiltIn Position
       // %float = OpTypeFloat 32
       // %v4float = OpTypeVector %float 4
       // %ptr = OpTypePointer Output %v4float
       // %return_value = OpVariable %ptr Output

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn frag_main([[builtin(position)]] coord_in: vec4<f32>) -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
      return vec4<f32>(coord_in.x, coord_in.y, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
       // OpEntryPoint Fragment %frag_main "frag_main" %return_value %coord_in
       // OpDecorate %return_value Location 0
       // %float = OpTypeFloat 32
       // %v4float = OpTypeVector %float 4
       // %ptr = OpTypePointer Output %v4float
       // %return_value = OpVariable %ptr Output

    [[stage(compute)]]
    fn comp_main() { }
       // OpEntryPoint GLCompute %comp_main "comp_main"
  </xmp>
</div>

The set of <dfn noexport>functions in a shader stage</dfn> is the union of:

* The entry point function for the stage.
* The targets of function calls from within the body of a function
    in the shader stage, whether or not that call is executed.

The union is applied repeatedly until it stabilizes.
It will stabilize in a finite number of steps.

### Function attributes for entry points ### {#entry-point-attributes}

[SHORTNAME] defines the following attributes that can be applied to entry point declarations:
 * [=attribute/stage=]
 * [=attribute/workgroup_size=]

ISSUE: Can we query upper bounds on workgroup size dimensions?  Is it independent of the shader, or
  a property to be queried after creating the shader module?

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='workgroup_size Attribute'>
  <xmp>
    [[ stage(compute), workgroup_size(8,4,1) ]]
    fn sorter() { }
       // OpEntryPoint GLCompute %sorter "sorter"
       // OpExecutionMode %sorter LocalSize 8 4 1

    [[ stage(compute), workgroup_size(8u) ]]
    fn reverser() { }
       // OpEntryPoint GLCompute %reverser "reverser"
       // OpExecutionMode %reverser LocalSize 8 1 1

    // Using an pipeline-overridable constant.
    [[override(42)]] let block_width = 12u;
    [[ stage(compute), workgroup_size(block_width) ]]
    fn shuffler() { }
       // The SPIR-V translation uses a WorkgroupSize-decorated constant,
       // where the first component is an OpSpecConstant decorated with
       // SpecID 42, and with default value 12, and second and third components
       // use defaulted values of 1.

    // Error: workgroup_size must be specified on compute shader
    [[ stage(compute) ]]
    fn bad_shader() { }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Shader Interface ## {#shader-interface}

The shader interface is the set of objects
through which the shader accesses data external to the [=shader stage=],
either for reading or writing.
The interface includes:

* Pipeline inputs and outputs
* Buffer resources
* Texture resources
* Sampler resources

These objects are represented by module-scope variables in certain [=storage classes=].

We say a variable is <dfn noexport>statically accessed</dfn> by a function if any subexpression
in the body of the function uses the variable's [=identifier=],
and that subexpression is [=in scope=] of the variable's declaration.
Static access of a `let`-declared constant is defined similarly.
Note that being statically accessed is independent of whether an execution of the shader
will actually evaluate the subexpression, or even execute the enclosing statement.

More precisely, the <dfn noexport>interface of a shader stage</dfn> consists of:
  - all parameters of the entry point
  - the result value of the entry point
  - all [=module scope=] variables that are [=statically accessed=] by [=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=],
    and which are in storage classes [=storage classes/uniform=], [=storage classes/storage=], or [=storage classes/handle=].

### Pipeline Input and Output Interface ### {#pipeline-inputs-outputs}

The <dfn dfn>Entry point IO type</dfn>s include the following:
  - Built-in variables. See [[#builtin-inputs-outputs]].
  - User-defined IO. See [[#user-defined-inputs-outputs]]
  - Structures containing only built-in variables and user-defined IO.
    The structure must not contain a nested structure.

A <dfn noexport>pipeline input</dfn> is data provided to the shader stage from upstream in the pipeline.
A pipeline input is denoted by the arguments of the entry point.

A <dfn noexport>pipeline output</dfn> is data the shader provides for further processing downstream in the pipeline.
A pipeline output is denoted by the return type of the entry point.

Each pipeline input or output is one of:

* A built-in variable. See [[#builtin-inputs-outputs]].
* A user-defined value. See [[#user-defined-inputs-outputs]].

#### Built-in Inputs and Outputs #### {#builtin-inputs-outputs}

A <dfn noexport>built-in input variable</dfn> provides access to system-generated control information.
The set of built-in inputs are listed in [[#builtin-variables]].

To declare a variable for accessing a particular input built-in *X* from an entry point:

* Declare a parameter of the entry point function,
    where the [=store type=] is the listed store type for *X*.
* Apply a `builtin(`*X*`)` attribute to the parameter.

A <dfn noexport>built-in output variable</dfn> is used by the shader to convey
control information to later processing steps in the pipeline.
The set of built-in outputs are listed in [[#builtin-variables]].

To declare a variable for accessing a particular output built-in *Y* from an entry point:

* Add a variable to the result of the entry point, where [=store type=] is the listed store type for *Y*:
  * If there is no result type for the entry point, change it to the variable type.
  * Otherwise, make the result type to be a structure, where one of the fields is the new variable.
* Apply a `builtin(`*Y*`)` attribute to the result variable.

Both input and output built-in variables may also be declared as members of
structures that are either entry point function parameters (for inputs) or the
return type of an entry point (for outputs).
The type of the structure member must match the type specified for the built-in variable.

The `builtin` attribute must not be applied to a variables in [=module scope=],
or the local variables in the function scope.

A variable must not have more than one `builtin` attribute.

Each built-in variable has an associated shader stage, as described in [[#builtin-variables]].
If a built-in variable has stage *S* and is used by a function *F*, as either an argument or the
result type, then *F* must be a [=functions in a shader stage|function in a shader=] for stage *S*.

Issue: in Vulkan, builtin variables occoupy I/O location slots counting toward limits.

#### User-defined Inputs and Outputs #### {#user-defined-inputs-outputs}

User-defined data can be passed as input to the start of a pipeline, passed
between stages of a pipeline or output from the end of a pipeline.
User-defined IO must not be passed to [=compute=] shader entry points.
User-defined IO must be of [=numeric scalar=] or [=numeric vector=] type,
or of a structure type whose members are numeric scalars or vectors.
All user-defined IO must be assigned locations (See [[#input-output-locations]]).

#### Interpolation #### {#interpolation}

Authors can control how user-defined IO data is interpolated through the use of
the [=attribute/interpolate=] attribute.
[SHORTNAME] offers two aspects of interpolation to control: the type of
interpolation, and the sampling of the interpolation.

The <dfn noexport>interpolation type</dfn> must be one of:
* `perspective` - Values are interpolated in a perspective correct manner.
* `linear` - Values are interpolated in a linear, non-perspective correct manner.
* `flat` - Values are not interpolated.
    Interpolation sampling is not used with `flat` interpolation.

The <dfn noexport>interpolation sampling</dfn> must be one of:
* `center` - Interpolation is performed at the center of the pixel.
* `centroid` - Interpolation is performed at a point that lies within all the
    samples covered by the fragment within the current primitive.
    This value is the same for all samples in the primitive.
* `sample` - Interpolation is performed per sample.
    The [=fragment=] shader is invoked once per sample when this attribute is
    applied.

For user-defined IO of scalar or vector floating-point type:
* If the interpolation attribute is not specified, then `[[interpolate(perspective, center)]]` is assumed.
* If the interpolation attribute is specified with an interpolation type:
    * If the interpolation type is `flat`, then interpolation sampling must not be specified.
    * If the interpolation type is `perspective` or `linear`, then:
         * Any interpolation sampling is valid.
         * If interpolation sampling is not specified, `center` is assumed.

User-defined IO of scalar or vector integer type is always
`[[interpolate(flat)]]` and, therefore, must not be specified in a [SHORTNAME] program.

Interpolation attributes must match between [=vertex=] outputs and [=fragment=]
inputs with the same [=attribute/location=] assignment within the same [=pipeline=].

#### Input-output Locations #### {#input-output-locations}

Each location can store a value up to 16 bytes in size.
The byte size of a type is defined using the *SizeOf* column in [[#alignment-and-size]].
For example, a four-element vector of floating-point values occupies a single location.

Locations are specified via the [=attribute/location=] attribute.

Every user-defined input and output must have a fully specified set of
locations.
Each structure member in the entry point IO must be one of either a builtin variable
(see [[#builtin-inputs-outputs]]), or assigned a location.

Locations must not overlap within each of the following sets:
* Members within a structure type.
    This applies to any structure, not just those used in pipeline inputs or outputs.
* An entry point's pipeline inputs,
    i.e. locations for its formal parameters, or for the members of its formal parameters of structure type.

Note: Location numbering is distinct between inputs and outputs:
Location numbers for an entry point's pipeline inputs do not conflict with location numbers for the entry point's pipeline outputs.

Note: No additional rule is required to prevent location overlap within an entry point's outputs.
When the outptut is a structure, the first rule above prevents overlap.
Otherwise, the output is a scalar or a vector, and can have only a single location assigned to it.

Note: The number of available locations for an entry point is defined by the WebGPU API.

<div class='example applying location attribute' heading='Applying location attributes'>
  <xmp>
    struct A {
      [[location(0)]] x: f32;
      // Despite locations being 16-bytes, x and y cannot share a location
      [[location(1)]] y: f32;
    };

    // in1 occupies locations 0 and 1.
    // in2 occupies location 2.
    // The return value occupies location 0.
    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn fragShader(in1: A, [[location(2)]] in2: f32) -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
     // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

User-defined IO can be mixed with builtin variables in the same structure. For example,

<div class='example mixing builtins and user-defined IO' heading='Mixing builtins and user-defined IO'>
  <xmp>
    // Mixed builtins and user-defined inputs.
    struct MyInputs {
      [[location(0)]] x: vec4<f32>;
      [[builtin(front_facing)]] y: bool;
      [[location(1)]] z: u32;
    };

    struct MyOutputs {
      [[builtin(frag_depth)]] x: f32;
      [[location(0)]] y: vec4<f32>;
    };

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn fragShader(in1: MyInputs) -> MyOutputs {
      // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example invalid locations' heading='Invalid location assignments'>
  <xmp>
    struct A {
      [[location(0)]] x: u32;
      // Invalid, x and y cannot share a location.
      [[location(0)]] y: u32;
    };

    struct B {
      [location(0)]] x: f32;
    };

    struct C {
      // Invalid, structures with user-defined IO cannot be nested.
      b: B;
    };

    struct D {
      x: vec4<f32>;
    };

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    // Invalid, location cannot be applied to a structure type.
    fn fragShader1([[location(0)]] in1: D) {
      // ...
    }

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    // Invalid, in1 and in2 cannot share a location.
    fn fragShader2([location(0)]] in1: f32, [[location(0)]] in2: f32) {
      // ...
    }

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    // Invalid, location cannot be applied to a structure.
    fn fragShader3([[location(0)]] in1: vec4<f32>) -> [[location(0)]] D {
      // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Resource interface ### {#resource-interface}

A <dfn noexport>resource</dfn> is an object,
other than a [[#pipeline-inputs-outputs|pipeline input or output]],
which provides access to data external to a [=shader stage=].
Resources are shared by all invocations of the shader.

There are four kinds of resources:

* [=uniform buffers=]
* [=storage buffers=]
* textures
* samplers

The <dfn noexport>resource interface of a shader</dfn> is the set of module-scope
resource variables [=statically accessed=] by
[=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=].

Each resource variable must be declared with both [=group=] and [=binding=]
attributes.
Together with the shader's stage, these identify the binding address
of the resource on the shader's pipeline.
See [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout|WebGPU &sect; GPUPipelineLayout]].

Bindings must not alias within a shader stage:
two different variables in the resource interface of a given
shader must not have the same group and binding values, when considered as a pair of values.

### Resource layout compatibility ### {#resource-layout-compatibility}

WebGPU requires that a shader's resource interface match the [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout|layout of the pipeline]]
using the shader.

Each [SHORTNAME] variable in a resource interface must be bound to a WebGPU resource with
a compatible
[[WebGPU#binding-resource-type|resource type]] and
[[WebGPU#binding-type|binding type]],
where compatibility is defined by the following table.

If |B| is a [=uniform buffer=] variable in a resource interface,

# Language extensions # {#language-extensions}

The [SHORTNAME] language is expected to evolve over time.

An <dfn noexport>extension</dfn> is a named grouping for a coherent
set of modifications to a particular version of the [SHORTNAME] specification, consisting of any combination of:
* Addition of new concepts and behaviours via new syntax, including:
    * declarations, statements, attributes, and built-in functions.
* Removal of restrictions in the current specification or in previously published extensions.
* Syntax for reducing the set of permissible behaviours.
* Syntax for limiting the features available to a part of the program.
* A description of how the extension interacts with the existing specification, and optionally with other extensions.

Hypothetically, extensions could be used to:
* Add numeric scalar types, such as 16-bit integers.
* Add syntax to constrain floating point rounding mode.
* Add syntax to signal that a shader does not use atomic types.
* Add new kinds of statements.
* Add new built-in functions.
* Add constraints on how shader invocations execute.
* Add new shader stages.

## Enable Directive ## {#enable-directive-section}

An <dfn noexport>enable directive</dfn> indicates that the functionality
described by a particular named
[=extension=] may be used in the source text after the directive itself.
That is, language functionality described by the extension may be used in any
source text after the `enable` directive.

The directive must not appear inside the text of any [=declaration=].
(If it were a declaration, it would be at [=module scope=].)

The directive uses an [=identifier=] to name the extension, but does not
create a [=scope=] for the identifier.
Use of the identifier by the directive does not conflict with the
use of that identifier as the name in any [=declaration=].

<pre class='def'>
enable_directive
  : ENABLE IDENT SEMICOLON
</pre>

Note: The grammar rule includes the terminating semicolon token,
ensuring the additional functionality is usable only after that semicolon.
Therefore any [SHORTNAME] implementation can parse the entire `enable` directive.
When an implementation encounters an enable directive for an unsupported extension,
the implementation can issue a clear diagnostic.

<div class='example using extensions' heading="Using hypothetical extensions">
  <xmp>
    // Enable a hypothetical IEEE-754 binary16 floating point extension.

    //    - as operands to the division operator: /
    fn halve_it(x: f16) -> f16 {

## Compute Shaders and Workgroups ## {#compute-shader-workgroups}

A <dfn noexport for="compute shader stage">workgroup</dfn> is a set of invocations which
concurrently execute a [=compute shader stage=] [=entry point=],
and share access to shader variables in the [=storage classes/workgroup=] storage class.

The <dfn noexport>workgroup grid</dfn> for a compute shader is the set of points
with integer coordinates *(i,j,k)* with:

*  0 &leq; i &lt; workgroup_size_x
*  0 &leq; j &lt; workgroup_size_y
*  0 &leq; k &lt; workgroup_size_z

where *(workgroup_size_x, workgroup_size_y, workgroup_size_z)* is
the value specified for the [=workgroup_size=] attribute of the
entry point.

There is exactly one invocation in a workgroup for each point in the workgroup grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>local invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding workgroup grid point.

When an invocation has [=local invocation ID=] (i,j,k), then its
<dfn noexport>local invocation index</dfn> is

  i +
  (j * workgroup_size_x) +
  (k * workgroup_size_x * workgroup_size_y)

<p algorithm="local index range">Note that if a workgroup has |W| invocations,
then each invocation |I| the workgroup has a unique local invocation index |L|(|I|)
such that 0 &le; |L|(|I|) &lt; |W|,
and that entire range is covered.</p>

A compute shader begins execution when a WebGPU implementation
removes a dispatch command from a queue and begins the specified work on the GPU.
The dispatch command specifies a <dfn noexport>dispatch size</dfn>,
which is an integer triple *(group_count_x, group_count_y, group_count_z)*
indicating the number of workgroups to be executed, as described in the following.

The <dfn noexport>compute shader grid</dfn> for a particular dispatch
is the set of points with integer coordinates *(CSi,CSj,CSk)* with:

*  0 &leq; CSi &le; workgroup_size_x &times; group_count_x
*  0 &leq; CSj &le; workgroup_size_y &times; group_count_y
*  0 &leq; CSk &le; workgroup_size_z &times; group_count_z

where *workgroup_size_x*,
*workgroup_size_y*, and
*workgroup_size_z* are as above for the compute shader entry point.

The work to be performed by a compute shader dispatch is to execute exactly one
invocation of the entry point for each point in the compute shader grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>global invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding compute shader grid point.

The invocations are organized into workgroups, so that each invocation
*(CSi, CSj, CSk)* is identified with the workgroup grid point

   ( *CSi* mod workgroup_size_x ,
     *CSj* mod workgroup_size_y ,

WebGPU provides no guarantees about:

* Whether invocations from different workgroups execute concurrently.
    That is, you cannot assume more than one workgroup executes at a time.
* Whether, once invocations from a workgroup begin executing, that other workgroups
    are blocked from execution.
    That is, you cannot assume that only one workgroup executes at a time.
    While a workgroup is executing, the implementation may choose to
    concurrently execute other workgroups as well, or other queued but unblocked work.
* Whether invocations from one particular workgroup begin executing before
    the invocations of another workgroup.
    That is, you cannot assume that workgroups are launched in a particular order.

Issue: [WebGPU issue 1045](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1045):
Dispatch group counts must be positive.
However, how do we handle an indirect dispatch that specifies a group count of zero.

## Collective operations TODO ## {#collective-operations}

### Barrier TODO ### {#barrier}

### Derivatives ### {#derivatives}

A <dfn noexport>partial derivative</dfn> is the rate of change of a value along an axis.

Fragment shader invocations operating on neighbouring fragments (in screen-space coordinates)
collaborate to compute approximate partial derivatives.

Partial derivatives of the *fragment coordinate* are computed implicitly as part
of operation of the following built-in functions:
* [[#texturesample|textureSample]],
* [[#texturesamplebias|textureSampleBias]], and
* [[#texturesamplecompare|textureSampleCompare]].

For these, the derivatives help determine the mip levels of texels to be sampled, or in the case of
`textureSampleCompare`, sampled and compared against a reference value.

Partial derivatives of *invocation-specified* values are computed by the
built-in functions described in [[#derivative-builtin-functions]]:
* dpdx, dpdxCoarse, and dpdxFine compute partial derivatives along the x axis.
* dpdy, dpdyCoarse, and dpdyFine compute partial derivatives along the y axis.
* fwidth, fwidthCoarse, and fwidthFine compute the Manhattan metric over the associated x and y partial derivatives.

Because neighbouring invocations must collaborate to compute derivatives,
these functions must only be invoked in uniform control flow in a fragment shader.

### Arrayed resource access TODO ### {#arrayed-resource-access}

## Floating Point Evaluation ## {#floating-point-evaluation}

[SHORTNAME] follows the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] standard for floating point computation with
the following exceptions:
* No floating point exceptions are generated.
* Signaling NaNs may not be generated.
    Any signaling NaN may be converted to a quiet NaN.
* Implementations may assume that NaNs, inifinities are not present
    * Note: This means some functions (e.g. `isInf`, `isNan`, `min` and `max`)
        may not return the expected result due to optimizations about the presence
        of NaNs and infinities.
* Implementations may ignore the sign of a zero.
    That is, a zero with a positive sign may behave like a zero a with a negative sign, and vice versa.
* No rounding mode is specified.
* Implementations may flush denormalized value on the input and/or output of
    any operation listed in [[#floating-point-accuracy]].
    * Other operations are required to preserve denormalized numbers.
* The accuracy of operations is given in [[#floating-point-accuracy]].

### Floating Point Accuracy ### {#floating-point-accuracy}

<div algorithm="correctly rounded">
Let |x| be the exact real-valued or infinite result of an operation when computed with unbounded precision.
The <dfn>correctly rounded</dfn> result of the operation for floating point type |T| is:
* |x|, when |x| is in |T|,
* Otherwise:
    * the smallest value in |T| greater than |x|, or
    * the largest value in |T| less than |x|.

</div>

That is, the result may be rounded up or down:
[SHORTNAME] does not specify a rounding mode.

Note: Floating point types include positive and negative infinity, so
the correctly rounded result may be finite or infinite.

The units in the last place, <dfn noexport>ULP</dfn>, for a floating point
number `x` is the minimum distance between two non-equal floating point numbers
`a` and `b` such that `a` &le; `x` &le; `b` (i.e. `ulp(x) =
min`<sub>`a,b`</sub>`|b - a|`).

In the following tables, the accuracy of an operation is provided among five
possibilities:
* Correct result (for non-floating point return values)
* [=Correctly rounded=]
* A relative error expressed as [=ULP=]
* A function that the accuracy is <dfn noexport>inherited from</dfn>.
    That is, the accuracy is equal to implementing the operation in terms of the derived function.
* An absolute error

For any accuracy values specified over a range, the accuracy is undefined for
results outside that range.

If an allowable return value for any operation is greater in magnitude than the
largest representable finite floating-point value, then that operation may additionally
return either the infinity with the same sign or the largest finite
value with the same sign.

<dfn noexport>Reassociation</dfn> is the reordering of operations in an
expression such that the answer is the same if computed exactly. For example:
* `(a + b) + c` reassociates to `a + (b + c)`
* `(a - b) + c` reassociates to `(a + c) - b`
* `(a * b) / c` reassociates to `(a / c) * b`

However, the result may not be the same when computed in floating point.
The reassociated result may be inaccurate due to approximation, or may trigger
an overflow or NaN when computing intermediate results.

An implementation may reassociate and/or fuse operations if the optimization is
at least as accurate as the original formulation.

### Floating point conversion ### {#floating-point-conversion}

In this section, a floating point type may be any of:
* The [=f32=] type in WGSL.
* A hypothetical type corresponding to a binary format defined by the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]]
    floating point standard.

    Note: The binary16 format is referenced in this way.

Note: Recall that the [=f32=] WGSL type corresponds to the IEEE-754 binary32 format.

When converting a floating point scalar value to an integral type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
* If the original value has a fractional component, then it cannot be represented exactly in the destination type, and the result is TODO
* If the original value is out of range of the destination type, then TODO.

When converting a value to a floating point type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
    * If the original value is zero and of integral type, then the resulting value has a zero sign bit.
* Otherwise, the original value is not exactly representable.
    * If the original value is different from but lies between two adjacent values representable in the destination type,
         then the result is one of those two values.
         [SHORTNAME] does not specify whether the larger or smaller representable
         value is chosen, and different instances of such a conversion may choose differently.
    * Otherwise, if the original value lies outside the range of the destination type.
         * This does not occur when the original types is one of [=i32=] or [=u32=] and the destination type is [=f32=].
         * This does not occur when the source type is a floating point type with fewer exponent and mantissa bits.
         * If the source type is a floating point type with more mantissa bits than the destination type, then:
             * The extra mantissa bits of the source value may be discarded (treated as if they are 0).
                 * If the resulting value is the maximum normal value of the destination type, then that is the result.
             * Otherwise the result is the infinity value with the same sign as the source value.
    * Otherwise, if the original value is a NaN for the source type, then the result is a NaN in the destination type.

NOTE: An integer value may lie between two adjacent representable floating point values.
In particular, the [=f32=] type uses 23 explicit fractional bits.
Additionally, when the floating point value is in the normal range (the exponent is neither extreme value), then the mantissa is
the set of fractional bits together with an extra 1-bit at the most significant position at bit position 23.
Then, for example, integers 2<sup>28</sup> and 1+2<sup>28</sup> both map to the same floating point value: the difference in the
least significant 1 bit is not representable by the floating point format.
This kind of collision occurs for pairs of adjacent integers with a magnitude of at least 2<sup>25</sup>.

Issue: (dneto) Default rounding mode is an implementation choice.  Is that what we want?

Issue: Check behaviour of the f32 to f16 conversion for numbers just beyond the max normal f16 values.
I've written what an NVIDIA GPU does.  See https://github.com/google/amber/pull/918 for an executable test case.

# Built-in functions # {#builtin-functions}

Certain functions are always available in a [SHORTNAME] program,
and are provided by the implementation.
These are called <dfn noexport>built-in functions</dfn>.

Since a built-in function is always in scope, it is an error to attempt to redefine
one or to use the name of a built-in function as an [=identifier=] for any other
kind of declaration.

Unlike ordinary functions defined in a [SHORTNAME] program,
a built-in function may use the same function name with different
sets of parameters.
In other words, a built-in function may have more than one *overload*,
but ordinary function definitions in [SHORTNAME] may not.

When calling a built-in function, all arguments to the function are evaluated
before function evaulation begins.

TODO(dneto): Elaborate the descriptions of the built-in functions.  So far I've only reorganized
the contents of the existing table.

TODO: Explain the use of a function prototype in the table: provides name, formal parameter list, and return type.
That's not a full user-defined function declaration.

textureSampleCompare(t: texture_depth_cube_array, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec3<f32>, array_index: i32, depth_ref: f32) -> f32
```

**Parameters:**

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [depth](#texture-depth) texture to sample.
  <tr><td>`s`<td>
  The [sampler comparision](#sampler-type) type.
  <tr><td>`coords`<td>
  The texture coordinates used for sampling.
  <tr><td>`array_index`<td>
  The 0-based texture array index to sample.
  <tr><td>`depth_ref`<td>
  The reference value to compare the sampled depth value against.
  <tr><td>`offset`<td>
  The optional texel offset applied to the unnormalized texture coordinate
  before sampling the texture. This offset is applied before applying any
  texture wrapping modes.<br>
  The `offset` expression must be a `const_expression` expression (e.g. `vec2<i32>(1, 2)`).<br>
  Each `offset` component must be at least `-8` and at most `7`. Values outside
  of this range will result in a [=shader-creation error=].
</table>

**Returns:**

A value in the range `[0.0..1.0]`.

Each sampled texel is compared against the reference value using the comparision
operator defined by the `sampler_comparison`, resulting in either a `0` or `1`
value for each texel.

If the sampler uses bilinear filtering then the returned value is
the filtered average of these values, otherwise the comparision result of a
single texel is returned.


### `textureSampleCompareLevel` ### {#texturesamplecomparelevel}

Samples a depth texture and compares the sampled depth values against a reference value.

```rust
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_2d, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec2<f32>, depth_ref: f32) -> f32
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_2d, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec2<f32>, depth_ref: f32, offset: vec2<i32>) -> f32
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_2d_array, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec2<f32>, array_index: i32, depth_ref: f32) -> f32
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_2d_array, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec2<f32>, array_index: i32, depth_ref: f32, offset: vec2<i32>) -> f32
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_cube, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec3<f32>, depth_ref: f32) -> f32
textureSampleCompareLevel(t: texture_depth_cube_array, s: sampler_comparison, coords: vec3<f32>, array_index: i32, depth_ref: f32) -> f32
```

The `textureSampleCompareLevel` function is the same as `textureSampleCompare`, except that:

* `textureSampleCompareLevel` always samples texels from mip level 0.
    * The function does not compute derivatives.
    * There is no requirement for `textureSampleCompareLevel` to be invoked in uniform control flow.
* `textureSampleCompareLevel` may be invoked in any shader stage.

  Each `offset` component must be at least `-8` and at most `7`. Values outside
  of this range will result in a [=shader-creation error=].
</table>

**Returns:**

The sampled value.


### `textureSampleLevel` ### {#texturesamplelevel}

[See the texel format table](#storage-texel-formats) for the mapping of texel
format to channel format.

**Parameters:**

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [write-only storage texture](#texture-storage).
  <tr><td>`coords`<td>
  The 0-based texel coordinate.<br>
  <tr><td>`array_index`<td>
  The 0-based texture array index.
  <tr><td>`value`<td>
  The new texel value.<br>
</table>

**Note:**

An out-of-bounds access occurs if:
* any element of `coords` is outside the range `[0, textureDimensions(t))`
    for the corresponding element, or
* `array_index` is outside the range of `[0, textureNumLayers(t))`

If an out-of-bounds access occurs, the built-in function may do any of the following:
* not be executed
* store `value` to some in bounds texel

**TODO:**

<pre class='def'>
TODO(dsinclair): Need gather operations
</pre>

## Atomic built-in functions ## {#atomic-builtin-functions}

Atomic built-in functions can be used to read/write/read-modify-write atomic
objects. They are the only operations allowed on [[#atomic-types]].

All atomic built-in functions use a `relaxed` memory ordering (**0**-value
integral constant in SPIR-V for all `Memory Semantics` operands).
This means synchronization and ordering guarantees only apply among atomic
operations acting on the same [=memory locations=].
No synchronization or ordering guarantees apply between atomic and
non-atomic memory accesses, or between atomic accesses acting on different
memory locations.

Atomic built-in functions `must` not be used in a [=vertex=] shader stage.

The storage class `SC` of the `atomic_ptr` parameter in all atomic built-in
functions `must` be either [=storage classes/storage=] or [=storage
classes/workgroup=]. [=storage classes/workgroup=] atomics have a **Workgroup**
memory scope in SPIR-V, while [=storage classes/storage=] atomics have a
**Device** memory scope in SPIR-V.

The access mode `A` in all atomic built-in functions must be [=access/read_write=].

TODO: Add links to the eventual memory model descriptions.

### Atomic Load ### {#atomic-load}

```rust
atomicLoad(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>) -> T

// Maps to the SPIR-V instruction OpAtomicLoad.
```

Returns the atomically loaded the value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
It does not [=atomic modification|modify=] the object.

### Atomic Store ### {#atomic-store}

```rust
atomicStore(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T)

// Maps to the SPIR-V instruction OpAtomicStore.
```

Atomically stores the value `v` in the atomic object pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.

### Atomic Read-Modify-Write ### {#atomic-rmw}

```rust
atomicAdd(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicSub(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicMax(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicMin(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicAnd(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicOr(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T
atomicXor(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T

// Mappings to SPIR-V instructions:
// atomicAdd -> OpAtomicIAdd
// atomicSub -> OpAtomicISub
// atomicMax -> OpAtomicSMax or OpAtomicUMax (depending on the signedness of T)
// atomicMin -> OpAtomicSMin or OpAtomicUMin (depending on the signedness of T)
// atomicAnd -> OpAtomicAnd
// atomicOr  -> OpAtomicOr
// atomicXor -> OpAtomicXor
```
Each function performs the following steps atomically:

1. Load the original value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
2. Obtains a new value by performing the operation (e.g. max) from the function
    name with the value |v|.
3. Store the new value using `atomic_ptr`.

Each function returns the original value stored in the atomic object.

```rust
atomicExchange(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, v: T) -> T

// Maps to the SPIR-V instruction OpAtomicExchange.
```

Atomically stores the value `v` in the atomic object pointed to
`atomic_ptr` and returns the original value stored in the atomic object.

```rust
atomicCompareExchangeWeak(atomic_ptr: ptr<SC, atomic<T>, A>, cmp: T, v: T) -> vec2<T>

// Maps to the SPIR-V instruction OpAtomicCompareExchange.
```

Performs the following steps atomically:

1. Load the original value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
2. Compare the original value to the value `v` using an equality operation.
3. Store the value `v` `only if` the result of the equality comparison was **true**.

Returns a two-element vector, where the first element is the original value of
the atomic object and the second element is whether or not the comparison
succeeded (**1** if successful, **0** otherwise).

Note: the equality comparison may spuriously fail on some implementations. That
is, the second element of the result vector may be **0** even if the first
element of the result vector equals `cmp`.

## Data packing built-in functions ## {#pack-builtin-functions}

Data packing builtin functions can be used to encode values using data formats that
do not correspond directly to types in [SHORTNAME].
This enables a program to write many densely packed values to memory, which can
reduce a shader's memory bandwidth demand.

## Synchronization built-in functions ## {#sync-builtin-functions}

[SHORTNAME] provides the following synchronization functions:

```rust
fn storageBarrier()
fn workgroupBarrier()
```

All synchronization functions execute a control barrier with Acquire/Release
memory ordering. That is, all synchronization functions, and affected memory
and atomic operations are ordered in [[#program-order]] relative to the
synchronization function.  Additionally, the affected memory and atomic
operations program-ordered before the synchronization function must be visible
to all other threads in the workgroup before any affected memory or atomic
operation program-ordered after the synchronization function is executed by a
member of the workgroup.
All synchronization functions must only be used in the [=compute=] shader stage.

storageBarrier affects memory and atomic operations in the [=storage
classes/storage=] storage class.

workgroupBarrier affects memory and atomic operations in the [=storage
classes/workgroup=] storage class.

TODO: Add links to the eventual memory model.
