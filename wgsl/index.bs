# Introduction # {#intro}

WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) is the shader language for [[!WebGPU]].
That is, an application using the WebGPU API uses WGSL to express the programs, known as shaders,
that run on the GPU.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @fragment
    fn main() -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
        return vec4<f32>(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0);
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Technical Overview ## {#technical-overview}

WebGPU issues a unit of work to the GPU in the form of a [=GPU command=].
WGSL is concerned with two kinds of GPU commands:
* a <dfn noexport>draw command</dfn> executes a [=GPURenderPipeline|render pipeline=]
    in the context of [=shader stage input|inputs=], [=shader stage output|outputs=], and attached [=resources=].
* a <dfn noexport>dispatch command</dfn> executes a [=GPUComputePipeline|compute pipeline=]
    in the context of [=shader stage input|inputs=] and attached [=resources=].

Both kinds of pipelines use shaders written in WGSL.

A <dfn noexport>shader</dfn> is the portion of a WGSL program that executes a [=shader stage=] in a pipeline.
A shader comprises:
* An [=entry point=] [=function/function=].
* The transitive closure of all called functions, starting with the entry point.
    This set includes both [=user-defined function|user-defined=] and [=built-in function|built-in=] functions.
    (For a more rigorous definition, see "[=functions in a shader stage=]".)
* The set of variables and constants [=statically accessed=] by all those functions.
* The set of types used to define or analyze all those functions, variables, and constants.

Note: A WGSL program does not require an [=entry point=]; however, such a
program cannot be executed by the API because an entry point is required to
create a {{GPUProgrammableStage}}.

When executing a shader stage, the implementation:
* Computes the values of constants declared at [=module scope|module-scope=].
* Binds [=resources=] to variables in the shader's [=resource interface of a shader|resource interface=],
    making the contents of those resources available to the shader during execution.
* Allocates memory for other [=module scope|module-scope=] variables,
    and populates that memory with the specified initial values.
* Populates the formal parameters of the entry point, if they exist, with the shader stage's inputs.
* Connects the entry point [=return value=], if one exists, to the shader stage's outputs.
* Then it invokes the entry point.

A WGSL program is organized into:
* Functions, which specify execution behavior.
* Statements, which are declarations or units of executable behavior.
* Literals, which are text representations for pure mathematical values.
* Constants, each providing a name for a value computed at a specific time.
* Variables, each providing a name for memory holding a value.
* Expressions, each of which combines a set of values to produce a result value.
* Types, each of which describes:
    * A set of values.
    * Constraints on supported expressions.
    * The semantics of those expressions.

WGSL is an imperative language: behavior is specified as a sequence of statements to execute.
Statements can:
* Declare constants or variables.
* Modify the contents of variables.
* Modify execution order using structured programming constructs:
    * Selective execution: `if` (with optional `else if` and `else` clauses), `switch`.
    * Repetition: `loop`, `while`, `for`.
    * Escaping a nested execution construct: `continue`, `break`, `break if`.
    * Refactoring: function call and `return`.
* Evaluate expressions to compute values as part of the above behaviors.

WGSL is statically typed: each value computed by a particular expression is in a specific type,
determined only by examining the program source.

WGSL has types to describe booleans, numbers, vectors, matrices, and aggregations
of these in the form of arrays and structures.
Additional types describe memory.

WGSL does not have implicit conversions or promotions from [=type/concrete=]
types, but does provide implicit conversions and promotions from
[=type/abstract=] types.
Converting a value from one [=type/concrete=] numeric or boolean type to
another requires an explicit [[#conversion-expr|conversion]],
[[#type-constructor-expr|construction]], or [[#bitcast-expr|reinterpretation of
bits]]; however, WGSL does provide some limited facility to promote [=scalar=]
types to [=vector=] types.
This also applies to [=composite=] types.

WGSL has texture and sampler types.
Together with their associated built-in functions, these support functionality
commonly used for graphics rendering, and commonly provided by GPUs.

The work of a shader stage is partitioned into one or more <dfn noexport>invocations</dfn>,
each of which executes the entry point, but under slightly different conditions.
Invocations in a shader stage share access to certain variables:
* All invocations in the stage share the resources in the shader interface.
* In a [=compute shader stage|compute shader=], invocations in the same
     [=compute shader stage/workgroup=] share
     variables in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] [=address space=].
     Invocations in different workgroups do not share those variables.

However, the invocations act on different sets of shader stage inputs, including built-in inputs
that provide an identifying value to distinguish an invocation from its peers.
Each invocation has its own independent memory space in the form
of variables in the [=address spaces/private=] and [=address spaces/function=] address spaces.

Invocations within a shader stage execute concurrently, and may often execute in parallel.
The shader author is responsible for ensuring the dynamic behavior of the invocations
in a shader stage:
* Meet the [[#uniformity|uniformity]] requirements of certain primitive operations, including texture sampling and control barriers.
* Coordinate potentially conflicting accesses to shared variables, to avoid race conditions.

WGSL sometimes permits several possible behaviors for a given feature.
This is a portability hazard, as different implementations may exhibit the different behaviors.
The design of WGSL aims to minimize such cases, but is constrained by feasibility,
and goals for achieving high performance across a broad range of devices.

<dfn noexport>Behavioral requirements</dfn> are actions the implementation will
perform when processing or executing a WGSL program. They describe the
implementation's obligations in the contract with the programmer.
The specification explicitly states these obligations when they might not be otherwise obvious.

## Syntax Notation ## {#syntax-notation}

Following syntax notation describes the conventions of the syntactic grammar of WGSL:

* Italic text on both sides of a rule indicates a syntax rule.
* Bold monospace text starting and ending with single quotes (**'**) on the right-hand side of a rule indicates keywords and tokens.
* A colon (**:**) in regular text registers a syntax rule.
* A vertical bar (**|**) in regular text indicates alternatives.
* An question mark (**?**) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs zero or one times (is optional).
* An asterisk (<b>*</b>) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs zero or more times.
* A plus (**+**) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs one or more times.
* A matching pair of opening parenthesis (**(**) and closing parenthesis (**)**) in regular text indicates a group of elements.

## Mathematical Terms and Notation ## {#terms-and-notation}

<dfn noexport>Angles</dfn>:
* By convention, angles are measured in radians.
* The reference ray for measuring angles is the ray from the origin (0,0) toward (0,&infin;).
* Let &theta; be the angle subtended by a comparison ray and the reference ray.
    Then &theta; increases as the comparison ray moves counterclockwise.
* There are 2 &pi; radians in a complete circle.
* Examples:
    * The angle 0 points from the origin to the right, toward (1,0)
    * The angle 2&pi; points from the origin to the right, toward (1,0)
    * The angle &pi;/4 points from the origin to the point (1,1)
    * The angle &pi;/2 points from the origin to the point (0,1)
    * The angle &pi; points from the origin to the point (-1,0)
    * The angle (3/2)&pi; points from the origin to the point (0,-1)

The <dfn noexport>floor expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x| extended with &plus;&infin; and &minus;&infin;:

* &lfloor; &plus; &infin; &rfloor; = &plus;&infin;
* &lfloor; &minus; &infin; &rfloor; = &minus;&infin;
* for real number |x|, &lfloor;|x|&rfloor; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k| &le; |x| &lt; |k|+1

The <dfn noexport>ceiling expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x| extended with &plus;&infin; and &minus;&infin;:

* &lceil; &plus;&infin; &rceil; = &plus;&infin;
* &lceil; &minus;&infin; &rceil; = &minus;&infin;
* for real number |x|, &lceil;|x|&rceil; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k|-1 &lt; |x| &le; |k|

The <dfn noexport>truncate</dfn> function is defined over real numbers |x| extended with &plus;&infin; and &minus;&infin;:

* truncate(&plus;&infin;) = &plus;&infin;
* truncate(&minus;&infin;) = &minus;&infin;
* for real number |x|, computes the nearest whole number whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of |x|:
    * truncate(|x|) = &lfloor;|x|&rfloor; if |x| &ge; 0, and &lceil;|x|&rceil; if |x| &lt; 0.

The <dfn noexport>roundUp</dfn> function is defined for positive integers |k| and |n| as:

* roundUp(|k|, |n|) = &lceil;|n| &div; |k|&rceil; &times; |k|

The <dfn noexport>transpose</dfn> of an |c|-column |r|-row matrix |A| is the |r|-column |c|-row matrix
|A|<sup>T</sup> formed by copying the rows of |A| as the columns of |A|<sup>T</sup>:

* transpose(|A|) = |A|<sup>T</sup>
* transpose(|A|)<sub>|i|,|j|</sub> = |A|<sub>|j|,|i|</sub>

The transpose of a column vector is defined by interpreting the column vector as a 1-row matrix.
Similarly, the transpose of a row vector is defined by interpreting the row vector as a 1-column matrix.

# Shader Lifecycle # {#shader-lifecycle}

There are four key events in the lifecycle of a WGSL program and the shaders it may contain.
The first two correspond to the WebGPU API methods used to prepare a WGSL program
for execution.
The last two are the start and end of execution of a shader.

The events are:

1. <dfn noexport>Shader module creation</dfn>
    * This occurs when the
        WebGPU {{GPUDevice/createShaderModule()}} method
        is called.
        The source text for a WGSL program is provided at this time.
2. <dfn noexport>Pipeline creation</dfn>
    * This occurs when the
        WebGPU {{GPUDevice/createComputePipeline()}} method
        or the
        WebGPU {{GPUDevice/createRenderPipeline()}} method
        is invoked.
        These methods use one or more previously created shader modules, together with other
        configuration information.
3. <dfn noexport>Shader execution start</dfn>
    * This occurs when a [=draw command|draw=] or [=dispatch command=] is issued to the GPU,
        begins executing the pipeline,
        and invokes the [=shader stage=] [=entry point=] function.
4. <dfn noexport>Shader execution end</dfn>
    * This occurs when all work in the shader completes:
        * all its [=invocations=] terminate, and
        * all accesses to [=resources=] complete, and
        * outputs, if any, are passed to downstream pipeline stages.

The events are ordered due to:
*  data dependencies: shader execution requires a pipeline, and a pipeline requires a shader module.
*  causality: the shader must start executing before it can finish executing.

## Processing Errors ## {#processing-errors}

A WebGPU implementation may fail to process a shader for two reasons:

* A <dfn export>program error</dfn> occurs if the shader does not satisfy the requirements of the WGSL or WebGPU specifications.
* An <dfn noexport>uncategorized error</dfn> may occur
    even when all WGSL and WebGPU requirements have been satisfied.
    Possible causes include:
    * The shaders are too complex, exceeding the capabilities of the implementation,
        but in a way not easily captured by prescribed [[#limits|limits]].
        Simplifying the shaders may work around the issue.
    * A defect in the WebGPU implementation.


A processing error may occur during three phases in the shader lifecycle:

* A <dfn export>shader-creation error</dfn>
    is an error feasibly detectable at [=shader module creation=] time.
    Detection relies only on the WGSL program source text
    and other information available to the `createShaderModule` API method.
    Statements in this specification that describe something the program *must*
    do generally produce a shader-creation error if those assertions are violated.

* A <dfn export>pipeline-creation error</dfn>
    is an error detectable at [=pipeline creation=] time.
    Detection relies on the WGSL program source text
    and other information available to the particular pipeline creation API method.

* A <dfn export>dynamic error</dfn> is an error occurring during shader execution.
    These errors may or may not be detectable.

Note: For example, a race condition may not be detectable.

Each requirement [=behavioral requirement|will=] be checked at the earliest opportunity.
That is:
* A shader-creation error results when failing to meet a requirement detectable at shader-creation time.
* A pipeline-creation error results when failing to meet a requirement detectable at pipeline-creation time,
    but not detectable earlier.

When unclear from context, this specification indicates
whether failure to meet a particular requirement
results in a shader-creation, pipeline-creation, or dynamic error.

The WebGPU specification describes the consequences of each kind of error.

# Textual Structure # {#textual-structure}

The `text/wgsl` media type is used to identify content as a WGSL program.
See [[#text-wgsl-media-type]].

A WGSL program is Unicode text using the UTF-8 encoding, with no byte order mark (BOM).

WGSL program text consists of a sequence of Unicode [=code points=], grouped into contiguous non-empty sets forming:
* [=comments=]
* [=tokens=]
* [=blankspaces=]

The program text [=shader-creation error|must not=] include a null code point (`U+0000`).

## Parsing ## {#parsing}

To parse a WGSL program:
1. Remove [=comments=]:
    * Replace the first comment with a space code point (`U+0020`).
    * Repeat until no comments remain.
2. Parse the whole text, attempting to match the [=syntax/translation_unit=] grammar rule.
    Parsing uses a LALR(1) parser (one token of lookahead) [[!DeRemer1969]], with the following customization:
    * Tokenization is interleaved with parsing, and is context-aware.
        When the parser requests the next token:
        * Consume and ignore an initial sequence of [=blankspace=] code points.
        * A <dfn>token candidate</dfn> is any WGSL [=token=] formed from the non-empty prefix of the remaining unconsumed code points.
        * The token returned is the longest [=token candidate=] that is also a valid lookahead token for the current parser state. [[!VanWyk2007]]

A [=shader-creation error=] results if:
* the entire source text cannot be converted into a finite sequence of valid tokens, or
* the [=syntax/translation_unit=] grammar rule does not match the entire token sequence.

## Blankspace and Line Breaks ## {#blankspace-and-line-breaks}

<dfn>Blankspace</dfn> is any combination of one or more of code points from the Unicode
[=Unicode Standard Annex #31 for Unicode Version 14.0.0|Pattern_White_Space=] property.
The following is the set of code points in [=Unicode Standard Annex #31 for Unicode Version 14.0.0|Pattern_White_Space=]:
* space (`U+0020`)
* horizontal tab (`U+0009`)
* line feed (`U+000A`)
* vertical tab (`U+000B`)
* form feed (`U+000C`)
* carriage return (`U+000D`)
* next line (`U+0085`)
* left-to-right mark (`U+200E`)
* right-to-left mark (`U+200F`)
* line separator (`U+2028`)

</div>

A <dfn>line break</dfn> is a contiguous sequence of [=blankspace=] code points indicating the end of a line.
It is defined as the blankspace signalling a "mandatory break" as defined by
[=UAX14 Section 6.1 Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules=] [=UAX14 LB4|LB4=] and [=UAX14 LB5|LB5=].
That is, a line break is any of:
* line feed (`U+000A`)
* vertical tab (`U+000B`)
* form feed (`U+000C`)
* carriage return (`U+000D`) when not also followed by line feed (`U+000A`)
* carriage return (`U+000D`) followed by line feed (`U+000A`)
* next line (`U+0085`)
* line separator (`U+2028`)
* paragraph separator (`U+2029`)

Note: Diagnostics that report source text locations in terms of line numbers should use [=line breaks=] to
count lines.

## Comments ## {#comments}

A <dfn>comment</dfn> is a span of text that does not influence the validity or meaning of a WGSL
program, except that a comment can separate [=tokens=].
Shader authors can use comments to document their programs.

A <dfn noexport>line-ending comment</dfn> is a kind of [=comment=] consisting
of the two code points `//` (`U+002F` followed by `U+002F`) and the code points that follow,
up until but not including:
* the next [=line break=], or
* the end of the program.

A <dfn noexport>block comment</dfn> is a kind of [=comment=] consisting of:
* The two code points `/*` (`U+002F` followed by `U+002A`)
* Then any sequence of:
    * A [=block comment=], or
    * Text that does not contain either `*/` (`U+002A` followed by `U+002F`)
        or `/*` (`U+002F` followed by `U+002A`)
* Then the two code points `*/` (`U+002A` followed by `U+002F`)

Note: Block comments can be nested.
Since a block comment requires matching start and end text sequences, and allows arbitrary nesting,
a block comment cannot be recognized with a regular expression.
This is a consequence of the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Comments'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
  const f = 1.5; // This is line-ending comment.
  const g = 2.5; /* This is a block comment
                  that spans lines.
                  /* Block comments can nest.
                   */
                  But all block comments must terminate.
                 */
  </xmp>
</div>

## Tokens ## {#tokens}

A <dfn>token</dfn> is a contiguous sequence of code points forming one of:
* a [=literal=].
* a [=keyword=].
* a [=reserved word=].
* a [=syntactic token=].
* an [=identifier=].
* a [=context-dependent name=].

## Literals ## {#literals}

A <dfn>literal</dfn> is one of:
* A <dfn noexport>boolean literal</dfn>: either `true` or `false`.
* A <dfn>numeric literal</dfn>: either an [=integer literal=] or a [=floating point literal=],
    and is used to represent a number.

### Numeric Literals ### {#numeric-literals}

The form of a [=numeric literal=] is defined via pattern-matching.

An <dfn>integer literal</dfn> is:
* An integer specified as any of:
    * `0`
    * A sequence of decimal digits, where the first digit is not `0`.
    * `0x` or `0X` followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits.
* Then an optional `i` or `u` suffix.

A [=floating point literal=] has two logical parts: a mantissa to representing a fraction, and an optional exponent.
Roughly, the value of the literal is the mantissa multiplied by a base value raised to the given exponent.
A mantissa digit is <dfn dfn-for="mantissa">significant</dfn> if it is non-zero,
or if there are mantissa digits to its left and to its right that are both non-zero.
Significant digits are counted from left-to-right: the *N*'th significant digit has *N*-1 significant digits
to its left.

A <dfn noexport>decimal floating point literal</dfn> is:
* A mantissa, specified as a sequence of digits, with an optional decimal point (`.`) somewhere among them.
    The mantissa represents a fraction in base 10 notation.
* Then an optional exponent suffix consisting of:
    * `e` or `E`.
    * Then an exponent specified as an decimal number with an optional leading sign (`+` or `-`).
    * Then an optional `f` or `h` suffix.
* At least one of the decimal point, or the exponent, or the `f` or `h` suffix
     [=shader-creation error|must=] be present.
     If none are, then the token is instead an [=integer literal=].

</div>

Note: The decimal mantissa is truncated after 20 decimal digits, preserving approximately log(10)/log(2)&times;20 &approx; 66.4 significant bits in the fraction.


A <dfn noexport>hexadecimal floating point literal</dfn> is:
* A `0x` or `0X` prefix
* Then a mantissa, specified as a sequence of hexadecimal digits, with an optional hexadecimal point (`.`) somewhere among them.
    The mantissa represents a fraction in base 16 notation.
* Then an optional exponent suffix consisting of:
    * `p` or `P`
    * Then an exponent specified as an decimal number with an optional leading sign (`+` or `-`).
    * Then an optional `f` or `h` suffix.
* At least one of the hexadecimal point, or the exponent [=shader-creation error|must=] be present.

When a [=numeric literal=] has a suffix, the literal denotes a value in a specific [=type/concrete=] [=scalar=] type.
Otherwise, the literal denotes a value one of the [=abstract numeric types=] defined below.
In either case, the value denoted by the literal is its mathematical value after conversion to the target type,
following the rules in [[#floating-point-conversion]].

<table class=data>
  <caption>Mapping numeric literals to types</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Numeric Literal<th>Suffix<th>Type<th>Examples
  </thead>

  <tr><td>[=integer literal=]<td>`i`<td>[=i32=]<td>42i
  <tr><td>[=integer literal=]<td>`u`<td>[=u32=]<td>42u
  <tr><td>[=integer literal=]<td><td>[=AbstractInt=]<td>124
  <tr><td>[=floating point literal=]<td>`f`<td>[=f32=]<td>42f 1e5f 1.2f 0x1.0p10f

A [=shader-creation error=] results if:
* An [=integer literal=] with a `i` or `u` suffix cannot be represented by the target type.
* A [=hexadecimal floating point literal=] with a `f` or `h` suffix overflows or cannot be exactly represented by the target type.
* A [=decimal floating point literal=] with a `f` or `h` suffix overflows the target type.
* A [=floating point literal=] with a `h` suffix is used while the [=extension/f16|f16 extension=] is not enabled.

Note: The hexadecimal float value 0x1.00000001p0 requires 33 mantissa bits to be represented exactly,
but [=f32=] only has 23 explicit mantissa bits.

Note: If you want to use an `f` suffix to force a hexadecimal float literal to be of type, the literal must also
use a binary exponent.  For example, write `0x1p0f`.  In comparison, `0x1f` is a hexadecimal integer literal.

## Keywords ## {#keywords}

A <dfn>keyword</dfn> is a [=token=] which refers to a predefined language concept.
See [[#keyword-summary]] for the list of WGSL keywords.

## Identifiers ## {#identifiers}

An <dfn>identifier</dfn> is a kind of [=token=] used as a name.
See [[#declaration-and-scope]].

WGSL uses two grammar nonterminals to separate use cases:
* An [=syntax/ident=] is used to name a declared object.
* A [=syntax/member_ident=] is used to name a [=member=] of a [=structure=] type.

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>ident</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/ident_pattern_token=]
</div>
<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>member_ident</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/ident_pattern_token=]
</div>

The form of an identifier is based on the
[=Unicode Standard Annex #31 for Unicode Version 14.0.0|Unicode Standard Annex #31=] for
[[!UnicodeVersion14|Unicode Version 14.0.0]],
with the following elaborations.

Identifiers use the following profile described in terms of [=UAX31 Grammar=]:

```
<Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>* (<Medial> <Continue>+)*

<Start> := XID_Start + U+005F
<Continue> := <Start> + XID_Continue
<Medial> :=
```

This means identifiers with non-ASCII code points like these are
valid: `Δέλτα`, `réflexion`, `Кызыл`, `𐰓𐰏𐰇`, `朝焼け`, `سلام`, `검정`, `שָׁלוֹם`, `गुलाबी`, `փիրուզ`.

With the following exceptions:
* An identifier [=shader-creation error|must not=] have the same spelling as a [=keyword=] or as a [=reserved word=].
* An identifier [=shader-creation error|must not=] be `_` (a single underscore, `U+005F`).
* An identifier [=shader-creation error|must not=] start with `__` (two underscores, `U+005F` followed by `U+005F`).

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>ident_pattern_token</dfn> :

    | `/([_\p{XID_Start}][\p{XID_Continue}]+)|([\p{XID_Start}])/uy`
</div>

[=Unicode Character Database for Unicode Version 14.0.0=] includes non-normative listing
with all valid code points
of both [=UAX31 Lexical Classes|XID_Start=] and
[=UAX31 Lexical Classes|XID_Continue=].

Note: The [=return type=] for some [=built-in functions=] are structure types whose name cannot be used WGSL source.
Those structure types are described as if they were [=predeclared=] with a name starting with two underscores.
The result value can be saved into newly declared `let` or `var` using type inferencing, or immediately have one of its members
immediately extracted by name.  See example usages in the description of `frexp` and `modf`.

### Identifier Comparison ### {#identifier-comparison}

Two WGSL identifiers are the same if and only if they consist of the same sequence of code points.

Note: This specification does not permit Unicode normalization of values for the purposes of comparison.
Values that are visually and semantically identical but use different Unicode character sequences will not match.
Content authors are advised to use the same encoding sequence consistently or to avoid potentially troublesome
characters when choosing values. For more information, see [[CHARMOD-NORM]].

Note: A user agent should issue developer-visible warnings when the meaning of a WGSL program would change if
all instances of an identifier are replaced with one of that identifier's homographs.
(A homoglyph is a sequence of code points that may appear the same to a reader as another sequence of code points.
Examples of mappings to detect homoglyphs are the transformations, mappings, and matching algorithms mentioned in
the previous paragraph. Two sequences of code points are homographs if the identifier can transform one into the other by
repeatedly replacing a subsequence with its homoglyph.)

## Context-Dependent Names ## {#context-dependent-names}

A <dfn>context-dependent name</dfn> is a [=token=] used to name a concept, but only in specific grammatical contexts.
The spelling of the token may be the same as an [=identifier=], but the token does not [=resolve=] to a declared object.

Section [[#context-dependent-name-tokens]] lists all such tokens.

## Attributes ## {#attributes}

An <dfn noexport>attribute</dfn> modifies an object.
WGSL provides a unified syntax for applying attributes.
Attributes are used for a variety of purposes such as specifying the interface with the API.

Generally speaking, from the language's point-of-view, attributes can be
ignored for the purposes of type and semantic checking.
Additionally, the attribute name is a [=context-dependent name=], and
some attribute parameters are also context-dependent names.

An attribute [=shader-creation error|must not=] be specified more than once per object or type.

<table class='data'>

    Note: This attribute influences how a value of the enclosing structure type can appear in memory:
    at which byte addresses the structure itself and its component members can appear.

## Directives ## {#directives}

A <dfn noexport>directive</dfn> is a [=token=] sequence which modifies how a WGSL
program is processed by a WebGPU implementation.

Directives are optional.
If present, all directives [=shader-creation error|must=] appear before any [=declarations=] or [[#const-assert-statement|const assertions]].

See [[#enable-directive-section]].

# Declaration and Scope # {#declaration-and-scope}

A <dfn noexport>declaration</dfn> associates an [=identifier=] with one of
the following kinds of objects:
* a [=type=]
* a [=value declaration|value=]
* a [=variable=]
* a [=function/function=]
* a [=formal parameter=]

In other words, a declaration introduces a <dfn noexport>name</dfn> for an object.

A declaration is at <dfn noexport>module scope</dfn> if the declaration appears outside
the text of any other declaration.

A [=function/function=] declaration appears at module-scope.
A function declaration contains declarations for formal parameters, if it has any,
and it may contain [[#var-and-value|variable and value declarations]] inside its [=function body|body=].
Those contained declarations are therefore not at module-scope.

Note: The only kind of declaration that contain another declaration is a [=function declaration=].

Certain objects are provided by the WebGPU implementation, and are treated as
if they have been declared before the start of the WGSL program source.
We say such objects are <dfn noexport>predeclared</dfn>.
For example, WGSL predeclares [=built-in functions=], and built-in types such as [=i32=] and [=f32=].

The <dfn noexport>scope</dfn> of a declaration is the set of
program source locations where a declared identifier potentially denotes
its associated object.
We say the identifier is <dfn noexport>in scope</dfn>
(of the declaration) at those source locations.

Where a declaration appears determines its scope:
* Predeclared objects, and objects declared at module-scope, are [=in scope=] across the entire program source.
* Each [=formal parameter=] of a user-declared function is [=in scope=] across the corresponding [=function body=].
    See [[#function-declaration-sec]].
* Otherwise, the scope is a span of text beginning immediately after the end of the declaration.
    For details, see [[#var-and-value]].

Two declarations in the same WGSL source program [=shader-creation error|must not=] simultaneously:
* introduce the same identifier name, and
* have the same end-of-scope.

Note: A predeclared object does not have a declaration in the WGSL source.
So a declaration at module-scope or inside a function can have the same
name as a [=built-in function=].

TODO(#2941): Once built-in types are not named by keywords or reserved words, then user
declarations can also have the same name as a built-in type.

Identifiers are used as follows, distinguished by grammatical context:
* A token matching the [=syntax/ident=] grammar element is:
    * Used in a [=declaration=], as the name of the object being declared, or
    * Used as a name, denoting an object declared elsewhere.  This is the common case.
* A token matching the [=syntax/member_ident=] grammar element is:
    * Used in a [=structure=] type [=declaration=], as the name of a [=member=], or
    * Used as a name, denoting a member of a structure value, or denoting a reference to a member of a structure. See [[#struct-access-expr]].

When an [=syntax/ident=] token appears as a name denoting an object declared elsewhere,
it [=shader-creation error|must=] be [=in scope=] for some declaration.
The object denoted by the identifier token is determined as follows:
* If the token is in scope for at least one non-[=module scope|module-scope=] declaration,
    then the token denotes the object associated with the nearest of those declarations.

    Note: The nearest such declaration appears before the identifier token.

* Otherwise, if there is a module-scope declaration with that name, then the token
    denotes that declared object.

    Note: The module-scope declaration may appear before **or after** the identifier token.

* Otherwise, if there is a [=predeclared=] object with that name, then the token denotes that object.

When the above algorithm is used to map an identifier to a declaration, we
say the identifier <dfn noexport>resolves</dfn> to that declaration.
Similarly, we also say the identifier [=resolves=] to the declared object.

It is a [=shader-creation error=] if any [=module scope=] declaration is recursive.
That is, no cycles can exist among the declarations:

> Consider the directed graph where:
> * Each node corresponds to a declaration |D|.
> * There is an edge from declaration |D| to declaration |T| when the definition
>      for |D| mentions an identifier which [=resolves=] to |T|.
>
> This graph must not have a cycle.

Note: The [=function body=] is part of the [=function declaration=], thus
functions must not be recursive, either directly or indirectly.

Note: Use of a non-[=module scope=] identifier must follow the declaration of
that identifier in the text.

# Types # {#types}

Programs calculate values.

In WGSL, a <dfn noexport>type</dfn> is a set of values, and each value belongs to exactly one type.
A value's type determines the syntax and semantics of operations that can be performed on that value.

For example, the mathematical number 1 corresponds to these distinct values in [SHORTNAME]:
* the 32-bit signed integer value `1i`,
* the 32-bit unsigned integer value `1u`,
* the 32-bit floating point value `1.0f`,
* the 16-bit floating point value `1.0h` if the [=extension/f16|f16 extension=] is enabled,
* the [=AbstractInt=] value 1, and
* the [=AbstractFloat=] value 1.0

WGSL treats these as different because their machine representation and operations differ.

A type is either [=predeclared=], or created in WGSL source via a [=declaration=].

We distinguish between the *concept* of a type and the *syntax* in WGSL to denote that type.
In many cases the spelling of a type in this specification is the same as its WGSL syntax.
For example:
* the set of 32-bit unsigned integer values is spelled `u32` in this specification,
    and also in a WGSL program.
* the spelling is different for structure types, or types containing structures.

Some WGSL types are only used for analyzing a source program and
for determining the program's runtime behavior.
This specification will describe such types, but they do not appear in WGSL source text.

Note: WGSL [=reference types=] are not written in WGSL programs. See [[#ref-ptr-types]].

## Type Checking ## {#type-checking-section}

A WGSL value is computed by evaluating an expression.
An <dfn noexport>expression</dfn> is a segment of source text
parsed as one of the [SHORTNAME] grammar rules whose name ends with "`_expression`".
An expression |E| can contain <dfn noexport>subexpressions</dfn> which are expressions properly contained
in the outer expression |E|.
A <dfn noexport>top-level expression</dfn> is an expression that is not itself a subexpression.
See [[#expression-grammar]].

The particular value produced by an expression evaluation depends on:
* <dfn noexport>static context</dfn>:
    the source text surrounding the expression, and
* <dfn noexport>dynamic context</dfn>:
    the state of the invocation evaluating the expression,
    and the execution context in which the invocation is running.

The values that may result from evaluating a particular expression will always belong to a specific WGSL type,
known as the <dfn noexport>static type</dfn> of the expression.
The rules of WGSL are designed so that the static type of an expression depends
only on the expression's [=static context=].


A <dfn noexport>type assertion</dfn> is a mapping from some WGSL source expression to a WGSL type.
The notation

> *e* : *T*

is a type assertion meaning *T* is the static type of WGSL expression *e*.

Note: A type assertion is a statement of fact about the text of a program.
It is not a runtime check.


Statements often use expressions, and may place requirements on the static types of those expressions.
For example:
* The condition expression of an `if` statement [=shader-creation error|must=] be of type [=bool=].
* In a `let` declaration with an explicit type specified, the initializer
      expression [=shader-creation error|must=] evaluate to that type.

<dfn noexport>Type checking</dfn> a successfully parsed WGSL program is the process of mapping
each expression to its static type,
and verifying that type requirements of each statement are satisfied.
If type checking fails, a special case of a [=shader-creation error=], called a <dfn noexport>type error</dfn>, results.

Type checking can be performed by recursively applying [=type rules=]
to syntactic phrases, where a <dfn noexport>syntactic phrase</dfn> is either an [=expression=] or a [[#statements|statement]].
A <dfn noexport>type rule</dfn> describes how the [=static context=] for a [=syntactic phrase=]
determines the static type for expressions contained within that phrase.
A [=type rule=] has two parts:
* A <dfn noexport lt="type rule conclusion">conclusion</dfn>.
    * If the phrase is an expression, the conclusion is a [=type assertion=] for the expression.
    * If the phrase is a statement, the conclusion is a set of [=type assertions=],
        one for each of the statement's [=top-level expressions=].
    * In both cases, the [=syntactic phrases=] are specified schematically,
        using *italicized* names to denote subexpressions
        or other syntactically-determined parameters.
* <dfn noexport lt="type rule preconditions">Preconditions</dfn>, consisting of:
    * For expressions:
        * Type assertions for subexpressions, when it has subexpressions.
             Each may be satisfied directly, or via a [=feasible automatic conversion=] (as defined in [[#conversion-rank]]).
        * How the expression is used in a statement.
    * For statements:
        * The syntactic form of the statement, and
        * Type assertions for [=top-level expressions=] in the statement.
    * Conditions on the other schematic parameters, if any.
    * Optionally, other static context.

Type rules may have <dfn noexport>type parameters</dfn> in their preconditions and conclusions.
When a type rule's conclusion or preconditions contain type parameters,
we say it is <dfn noexport>parameterized</dfn>.
When they do not, we say the rule is <dfn noexport>fully elaborated</dfn>.
We can make a fully elaborated type rule from a parameterized one
by substituting a type for each of its type parameters,
using the same type for all occurrences of a given parameter in the rule.
An assignment of types to a rule's type parameters
is called a <dfn noexport>substitution</dfn>.

For example, here is the type rule for [[#logical-expr|logical negation]]
(an expression of the form `!`|e|):

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Precondition<th>Conclusion
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="example boolean negation"><td>|e|: |T|<br>
  |T| is bool or vec|N|&lt;bool&gt;
  <td>`!`|e|`:` |T|
</table>

This is a parameterized rule, because it contains the type parameter |T|,
which can represent any one of four types
[=bool=], `vec2<bool>`, `vec3<bool>`, or `vec4<bool>`.
Applying the substitution that maps |T| to `vec3<bool>`
produces the fully elaborated type rule:

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Precondition<th>Conclusion
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="example2 boolean negation"><td>|e|`: vec3<bool>`<br>
  <td>`!`|e|`: vec3<bool>`
</table>

Each fully elaborated rule we can produce from a parameterized rule
by applying some substitution that meets the rule's other conditions
is called an <dfn noexport>overload</dfn> of the parameterized rule.
For example, the boolean negation rule has four overloads,
because there are four possible ways to assign a type to its type parameter |T|.

Note:
In other words, a parameterized type rule provides the pattern
for a collection of fully elaborated type rules,
each one produced by applying a different substitution to the parameterized rule.

A <dfn noexport>type rule applies to a syntactic phrase</dfn> when:
* The rule's conclusion matches a valid parse of the [=syntactic phrase=], and
* The rule's preconditions are satisfied.

A [=parameterized=] type rule applies to an expression
if there exists a [=substitution=] producing a [=fully elaborated=] type rule
that applies to the expression.

Consider the expression, `1u+2u`.
It has two [[#literal-expressions|literal subexpressions]]: `1u` and `2u`, both of type u32.
The [=top-level expression=] is an addition.
Referring to the rules in [[#arithmetic-expr]], the type rule for addition applies to the expression, because:
* `1u+2u` matches a parse of the form |e1|+|e2|, with |e1| standing for `1u` and |e2| standing for `2u`, and
* |e1| is of type u32, and
* |e2| is of type u32, and
* we can substitute u32 for the type parameter |T| in the type rule,
    resulting in a [=fully elaborated=] rule that applies to the entire expression.

When analyzing a [=syntactic phrase=], three cases may occur:
* No type rules apply to the expression.  This results in a [=type error=].
* Exactly one [=fully elaborated=] type rule applies to the expression.
    In this case, the rule's [=type rule conclusion|conclusion=] is asserted, determining the static type for the expression.
* More than one type rule applies. That is, the preconditions for more than one [=overload=] are satisfied.
    In this case the tie-breaking procedure described in [[#overload-resolution-section]] is used.
    * If overload resolution succeeds, a single [=overload=] is determined to apply to the expression.
        The [=type assertions=] in the [=type rule conclusion|conclusion=] for that overload are asserted,
        and therefore determine the types for the expression or expressions in the [=syntactic phrase=].
    * If overload resolution fails, a [=type error=] results.

Continuing the example above, only one type rule applies to the expression `1u+2u`, and so type checking
accepts the conclusion of that type rule, which is that `1u+2u` is of type u32.

A WGSL source program is <dfn noexport>well-typed</dfn> when:
* The static type can be determined for each expression in the program by applying the type rules, and
* The type requirements for each statement are satisfied.

Otherwise there is a [=type error=] and the source program is not a valid WGSL program.

WGSL is a <dfn noexport>statically typed language</dfn>
because type checking a WGSL program [=behavioral requirement|will=] either succeed or
discover a type error, while only having to inspect the program source text.

### Type Rule Tables ### {#typing-tables-section}

The WGSL [=type rules=] for expressions are organized into <dfn noexport>type rule tables</dfn>,
with one row per type rule.

The <dfn noexport>semantics of an expression</dfn> is the effect of evaluating that expression,
and is primarily the production of a result value.
The *Description* column of the type rule that applies to an expression will specify the expression's semantics.
The semantics usually depends on the values of the type rule parameters, including
the assumed values of any subexpressions.
Sometimes the semantics of an expression includes effects other than producing
a result value, such as the non-result-value effects of its subexpressions.

TODO: example: non-result-value effect is any side effect of a function call subexpression.

### Conversion Rank ### {#conversion-rank}

When a type assertion |e|:|T| is used as a [=type rule precondition=], it is satisfied when:
* |e| is already of type |T|, or
* |e| is of type |S|, and type |S| is [=feasible automatic conversion|automatically convertible=] to type |T|, as defined below.

The rule is codified by the <dfn>ConversionRank</dfn> function over pairs of types, defined in the table below.
The [=ConversionRank=] function expresses the preference and feasibility of automatically converting a value of one type (*Src*) to
another type (*Dest*).
Lower ranks are more desirable.

A <dfn>feasible automatic conversion</dfn> converts a value from type *Src* to type *Dest*, and is allowed when [=ConversionRank=](*Src*,*Dest*) is finite.
Such conversions are value-preserving, subject to limitations described in [[#floating-point-evaluation]].

Note: Automatic conversions only occur in two kinds of situations.
First, when converting a [=const-expression=] to its corresponding typed numeric value that can be used on the GPU.
Second, when a load from a reference-to-memory occurs, yielding the value stored in that memory.

Note: A conversion of infinite rank is infeasible, i.e. not allowed.

Note: When no conversion is performed, the conversion rank is zero.

The type `T` is the <dfn noexport>concretization</dfn> of type `S` if:
* `T` is not a reference type, and
* ConversionRank(`S`, `T`) is finite, and
* For any other non-reference type `T2`, ConversionRank(`S`, `T2`) > ConversionRank(`S`, `T`).

The <dfn noexport>concretization of a value</dfn> `e` of type `T` is the value
resulting from applying, to `e`, the feasible conversion that maps `T` to the concretization of `T`.

### Overload Resolution ### {#overload-resolution-section}

When more than one [=type rule applies to a syntactic phrase=], a tie-breaking procedure is used
to determine which one should take effect.
This procedure is called <dfn noexport>overload resolution</dfn>,
and assumes type checking has already succeeded in finding static types for [=subexpressions=].

Consider a [=syntactic phrase=] |P|, and all [=type rule applies to a syntactic phrase|type rules that apply=] to |P|.
The overload resolution algorithm calls these type rules <dfn noexport>overload candidates</dfn>.
For each candidate:
* Its preconditions have been met either directly or through [=feasible automatic conversion|automatic conversion=].
* Its [=type rule conclusion|conclusion=] has:
    * A syntactic form matching a valid parse of |P|, and
    * A [=type assertion=] corresponding to each [=top-level expression=] in |P|.

Overload resolution for |P| proceeds as follows, with the goal of finding a single most [=preferable candidate|preferable=] [=overload candidate=]:

1. For each candidate |C|, enumerate conversion ranks for subexpressions in the syntactic phrase.
    The candidate's preconditions have been met, and so for the |i|'th subexpression in the |P|:
    * Its static type has been computed.
    * There is a [=feasible automatic conversion=] from the expression's static type to the type required by the corresponding type assertion in the preconditions.
        Let |C|.|R|(i) be the [=ConversionRank=] of that conversion.

1. Eliminate any candidate where one of its subexpressions resolves to an
    [=type/abstract=] type after [=feasible automatic conversions=], but another
    of the candidate's subexpressions is not a [=const-expression=].
    * That is, overload resolution [=behavioral requirement|will=] [=concretization|concretize=] the type of
        an expression unless all its subexpressions are [=const-expressions=].

1. Rank candidates: Given two overload candidates |C1| and |C2|, |C1| is <dfn lt="preferable candidate">preferred</dfn> over |C2| if:
    * For each expression position |i| in |P|, |C1|.|R|(i) &le; |C2|.|R|(i).
         * That is, each expression conversion required to apply |C1| to |P| is at least as preferable as the corresponding expression conversion required to apply |C2| to |P|.
    * There is at least one expression position |i| where |C1|.|R|(i) &lt; |C2|.|R|(i).
         * That is, there is at least one expression conversion required to apply |C1| that is strictly more preferable than the corresponding conversion required to apply |C2|.

1. If there is a single candidate |C| which is [=preferable candidate|preferred=] over all the others, then overload resolution succeeds, yielding the candidate type rule |C|.
      Otherwise, overload resolution fails.

TODO: Examples

## Plain Types ## {#plain-types-section}

[=Plain types=] are types for the machine representation of boolean values, numbers, vectors,
matrices, or aggregations of such values.

A <dfn>plain type</dfn> is either a [=scalar=] type, an [=atomic type|atomic=]
type, or a [=composite=] type.

Note: Plain types in WGSL are similar to Plain-Old-Data types in C++, but also
include atomic types and abstract numeric types.

### Abstract Numeric Types ### {#abstract-types}

These types cannot be spelled in WGSL source. They are only used by [=type checking=].

Certain expressions are evaluated at [=shader module creation|shader-creation time=],
and with a numeric range and precision that may be larger than directly implemented by the GPU.

[SHORTNAME] defines two <dfn>abstract numeric types</dfn> for these evaluations:
* The <dfn noexport>AbstractInt</dfn> type is the set of integers |i|, with -2<sup>63</sup> &leq; |i| &lt; 2<sup>63</sup>.
* The <dfn noexport>AbstractFloat</dfn> type is the set of finite floating point numbers representable
    in the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary64 (double precision) format.

An evaluation of an expression in one of these types [=shader-creation
error|must not=] overflow or produce infinite, NaN, undefined, or [=indeterminate value|indeterminate=] results.

A type is <dfn dfn-for="type" noexport>abstract</dfn> if it is an abstract
numeric type or contains an abstract numeric type.
A type is <dfn dfn-for="type" noexport>concrete</dfn> if it is not abstract.

A [=numeric literal=] without a suffix denotes a value in an [=abstract numeric type=]:
* An [=integer literal=] without an `i` or `u` suffix denotes an [=AbstractInt=] value.
* A [=floating point literal=] without an `f` suffix denotes a [=AbstractFloat=] value.

Example:  The expression `log2(32)` is analyzed as follows:
* `log2(32)` is parsed as a function call to the `log2` builtin function with operand [=AbstractInt=] value 32.
* There is no overload of `log2` with an [=integer scalar=] formal parameter.
* Instead [=overload resolution=] applies, considering two possible overloads and [=feasible automatic conversions=]:
    * [=AbstractInt=] to [=AbstractFloat=]. (Conversion rank 4)
    * [=AbstractInt=] to [=f32=]. (Conversion rank 5)
* The resulting computation occurs as an [=AbstractFloat=] (e.g. `log2(32.0)`).

Example:  The expression `1 + 2.5` is analyzed as follows:
* `1 + 2.5` is parsed as an addition operation with subexpressions [=AbstractInt=] value 1, and [=AbstractFloat=] value 2.5.
* There is no overload for |e|+|f| where |e| is integer type and |f| is floating point.
* However, using feasible automatic conversions, there are two potential overloads:
    * `1` is converted to [=AbstractFloat=] value `1.0` (rank 4) and `2.5` remains an [=AbstractFloat=] (rank 0).
    * `1` is converted to [=f32=] value `1.0f` (rank 5) and `2.5` is converted to [=f32=] value `2.5f` (rank 1).
* The first overload is the [=preferable candidate=] and type checking succeeds.
* The resulting computation occurs as an [=AbstractFloat=] `1.0 + 2.5`.

Example:  `let x = 1 + 2.5;`
* This example is similar to the above, except that `x` cannot resolve to an [=abstract numeric type=].
* Therefore, there is only one viable overload candidate: addition using [=f32=].
* The effect of the declaration is as if it were written `let x : f32 = 1.0f + 2.5f;`.

Example:  `1u + 2.5` results in a [=shader-creation error=]:
* The `1u` term is an expression of type [=u32=].
* The `2.5` term is an expression of type [=AbstractFloat=].
* There are no valid overload candidates:
    * There is no feasible automatic conversion from a GPU-materialized [=integer scalar=] type to a floating point type.
    * No type rule matches *e*`+`*f* with *e* in an [=integer scalar=] type, and *f* in a floating point type.

A vector is a <dfn noexport>numeric vector</dfn> if its component type is a [=numeric scalar=].

Key use cases of a vector include:

* to express both a direction and a magnitude.
* to express a position in space.
* to express a color in some color space.
    For example, the components could be intensities of red, green, and blue,
    while the fourth component could be an alpha (opacity) value.

Many operations on vectors act <dfn noexport>component-wise</dfn>, i.e. the
result vector is formed by operating on each component independently.

The key use case for a matrix is to embody a linear transformation.
In this interpretation, the vectors of a matrix are treated as column vectors.

The product operator (`*`) is used to either:

* scale the transformation by a scalar magnitude.
* apply the transformation to a vector.
* combine the transformation with another matrix.

See [[#arithmetic-expr]].

### Atomic Types ### {#atomic-types}

An <dfn noexport>atomic type</dfn> encapsulates a [=type/concrete=] [=integer scalar=] type such that:
* atomic objects provide [[#memory-model|certain guarantees]] to concurrent observers, and
* the only valid operations on atomic objects are the [[#atomic-builtin-functions|atomic builtin functions]].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="atomic type"><td>atomic&lt;|T|&gt;
    <td>Atomic of type |T|. |T| [=shader-creation error|must=] be either [=u32=] or [=i32=].
</table>

An expression [=shader-creation error|must not=] evaluate to an atomic type.

Atomic types may only be instantiated by variables in the [=address spaces/workgroup=]
address space or by [=storage buffer=] variables with a [=access/read_write=] access mode.
The [=memory scope=] of operations on the type is determined by the [=address space=]
it is instantiated in.
Atomic types in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] address space have a
[[#scoped-operations|memory scope]] of `Workgroup`, while those in the
[=address spaces/storage=] address space have a memory scope of `QueueFamily`.

An <dfn noexport>atomic modification</dfn> is any
[[#memory-operation|operation]] on an atomic object which sets the content of
the object.
The operation counts as a modification even if the new value is the same as the
object's existing value.

In WGSL, atomic modifications are mutually ordered, for each object.
That is, during execution of a shader stage, for each atomic object *A*, all
agents observe the same order of modification operations applied to *A*.
The ordering for distinct atomic objects may not be related in any way; no
causality is implied.
Note that variables in [=address spaces/workgroup=] space are shared within a
[=compute shader stage/workgroup=], but are not shared between different
workgroups.


### Array Types ### {#array-types}

An <dfn noexport>array</dfn> is an indexable grouping of element values.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td algorithm="fixed-size array type">array&lt;|E|,|N|&gt;
      <td>A <dfn>fixed-size array</dfn> with |N| elements of type |E|.<br>
          |N| is called the <dfn noexport>element count</dfn> of the array.
  <tr><td algorithm="runtime-sized array type">array&lt;|E|&gt;
      <td>A <dfn noexport>runtime-sized</dfn> array of elements of type |E|.
          These may only appear in specific contexts.<br>
</table>

The first element in an array is at index 0, and each successive element is at the next integer index.
See [[#array-access-expr]].

An expression [=shader-creation error|must not=] evaluate to a runtime-sized array type.

The element count expression |N| of a fixed-size array is subject to the following constraints:
* It [=shader-creation error|must=] be an [=override-expression=].
* It [=shader-creation error|must=] evaluate to a [=type/concrete=] [=integer scalar=].
* It is a [=pipeline-creation error=] if expression is not greater than zero.

Note:  The element count value is fully determined at [=pipeline creation=] time.

An array element type [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of:
* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* an [=array=] type having a [=creation-fixed footprint=]
* a [=structure=] type having a [=creation-fixed footprint=].

Note: The element type must be a [=plain type=].

Two array types are the same if and only if all of the following are true:
* They have the same element type.
* Their element count specifications match, i.e. one of the following is true:
    * They are both runtime-sized.
    * They are both fixed-sized with [=creation-fixed footprint=], and
        equal-valued element counts, even if one is signed and the other is unsigned.
        (Signed and unsigned values are comparable in this case because element counts
        are always positive.)
    * They are both fixed-sized with element counts specified as identifiers [=resolves|resolving=]
        to the same declaration of a [=pipeline-overridable=] constant.

<div class='example wgsl fixed-size array types' heading='Example fixed-size array types, non-overridable element count'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // array<f32,8> and array<i32,8> are different types:
    // different element types
    var<private> a: array<f32,8>;
    var<private> b: array<i32,8>;
    var<private> c: array<i32,8u>;  // array<i32,8> and array<i32,8u> are the same type

    const width = 8;
    const height = 8;

    // array<i32,8>, array<i32,8u>, and array<i32,width> are the same type.
    // Their element counts evaluate to 8.
    var<private> d: array<i32,width>;

    // array<i32,height> and array<i32,width> are the same type.
    var<private> e: array<i32,width>;
    var<private> f: array<i32,height>;
  </xmp>
</div>

Note: The only valid use of an array type sized by an overridable constant is
as a [=memory view=] in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] address space.
This includes the [=store type=] of a workgroup variable.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Workgroup variables sized by overridable constants">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    override blockSize = 16;

    var<workgroup> odds: array<i32,blockSize>;
    var<workgroup> evens: array<i32,blockSize>; // Same type

    // None of the following have the same type as 'odds' and 'evens'.

    // Different type: Not the identifier 'blockSize'
    var<workgroup> evens_0: array<i32,16>;
    // Different type: Uses arithmetic to express the element count.
    var<workgroup> evens_1: array<i32,(blockSize * 2 / 2)>;
    // Different type: Uses parentheses, not just an identifier.
    var<workgroup> evens_2: array<i32,(blockSize)>;

    // An invalid example, because the overridable element count may only occur
    // at the outer level.
    // var<workgroup> both: array<array<i32,blockSize>,2>;

    // An invalid example, because the overridable element count is only
    // valid for workgroup variables.
    // var<private> bad_address_space: array<i32,blockSize>;

### Structure Types ### {#struct-types}

A <dfn noexport>structure</dfn> is a named grouping of named <dfn noexport>member</dfn> values.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="structure type">
      <td>`struct`&nbsp;|AStructName|&nbsp;{<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;<var ignore>M<sub>1</sub></var> : <var ignore>T<sub>1</sub></var>,<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;<var ignore>M<sub>N</sub></var> : <var ignore>T<sub>N</sub></var>,<br>
           }
      <td> A declaration of a structure type named by [=identifier=] |AStructName|
           and having |N| members,
           where member <var ignore>i</var>
           is named by identifier <var ignore>M<sub>|i|</sub></var>
           and is of type <var ignore>T<sub>|i|</sub></var>.

           |N| [=shader-creation error|must=] be at least 1.

           Two members of the same structure type [=shader-creation error|must not=] have the same name.
</table>

Structure types are declared at [=module scope=].
Elsewhere in the program source, a structure type is denoted by its identifier name.
See [[#declaration-and-scope]].

Two structure types are the same if and only if they have the same name.

A structure member type [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of:
* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type with [=creation-fixed footprint=]
* a [=runtime-sized=] array type, but only if it is the last member of the structure
* a [=structure=] type that has a [=creation-fixed footprint=]

Note: All user-declared structure types are [=type/concrete=].

Note: Each member type must be a [=plain type=].

Some consequences of the restrictions structure member and array element types are:
* A pointer, texture, or sampler [=shader-creation error|must not=] appear in any level of nesting within an array or structure.
* When a [=runtime-sized=] array is part of a larger type, it may only appear
    as the last element of a structure, which itself cannot be part of an enclosing array or structure.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Structure">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // A structure with three members.
    struct Data {
      a: i32,
      b: vec2<f32>,
      c: array<i32,10>, // last comma is optional
    }

    // Declare a variable storing a value of type Data.
    var<private> some_data: Data;
  </xmp>

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>

The following attributes can be applied to structure members:
 * [=attribute/align=]
 * [=attribute/builtin=]
 * [=attribute/location=]
 * [=attribute/interpolate=]
 * [=attribute/invariant=]
 * [=attribute/size=]

Attributes [=attribute/builtin=], [=attribute/location=], [=attribute/interpolate=], and [=attribute/invariant=]
are [=IO attributes=].
An [=IO attribute=] on a member of a structure *S* has effect only when
*S* is used as the type of a [=formal parameter=] or [=return type=] of an [=entry point=].
See [[#stage-inputs-outputs]].

Attributes [=attribute/align=] and [=attribute/size=] are [=layout attributes=],
and may be required if the structure type is used to
define a [=uniform buffer=] or a [=storage buffer=].
See [[#memory-layouts]].

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Structure declaration'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct my_struct {
      a: f32,

</div>

### Composite Types ### {#composite-types}

A type is <dfn noexport>composite</dfn> if it has internal structure
expressed as a composition of other types.
The internal parts do not overlap, and are called <dfn noexport>components</dfn>.
A composite value may be decomposed into its components. See [[#composite-value-decomposition-expr]].

The composite types are:

* [=vector=] type
* [=matrix=] type
* [=array=] type
* [=structure=] type

For a composite type |T|, the <dfn>nesting depth</dfn> of |T|, written *NestDepth*(|T|) is:
* 1 for a vector type
* 2 for a matrix type
* 1 + *NestDepth*(|E|) for an array type with element type |E|
* 1 + max(*NestDepth*(*M*<sub>1</sub>),..., *NestDepth*(*M*<sub>N</sub>))
    if |T| is a structure type with member types *M*<sub>1</sub>,...,*M*<sub>1</sub>


### Constructible Types ### {#constructible-types}

Many kinds of values can be created, loaded, stored, passed into functions,
and returned from functions.
We call these [=constructible=].

A type is <dfn>constructible</dfn> if it is one of:

* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type, if it has [=creation-fixed footprint=] and its element type is constructible.
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members are constructible.

Note: All constructible types have a [=creation-fixed footprint=].

Note: Atomic types and runtime-sized array types are not constructible.
Composite types containing atomics and runtime-sized arrays are not constructible.

### Fixed-Footprint Types ### {#fixed-footprint-types}

The <dfn noexport>memory footprint</dfn> of a variable is the number of [=memory locations=]
used to store the contents of the variable.
The memory footprint of a variable depends on its [=store type=] and becomes finalized at some point
in the [[#shader-lifecycle|shader lifecycle]].
Most variables are sized very early, at [=Shader module creation|shader creation=] time.
Some variables may be sized later, at [=pipeline creation=] time,
and others as late as the [=shader execution start|start of shader execution=].

A type has a <dfn>creation-fixed footprint</dfn> if its [=feasible automatic
conversion|concretization=] has a size that is fully determined at [=shader
module creation|shader creation=] time.

A type has a <dfn>fixed footprint</dfn> if its size is fully determined
at [=pipeline creation=] time.

Note: Pipeline creation depends on shader creation, so a type with [=creation-fixed footprint=] also has [=fixed footprint=].

The types with [=creation-fixed footprint=] are:
* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type, when:
     * its [=element count=] is a [=const-expression=].
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members have [=creation-fixed footprint=].

Note: A [=constructible=] type has a [=creation-fixed footprint=].

The plain types with [=fixed footprint=] are any of:
* a type with [=creation-fixed footprint=]
* a [=fixed-size array=] type (without further constraining its [=element count=])

Note: The only valid use of a fixed-size array with an element count that is an
[=override-expression=] that is not a [=const-expression=] is as a
[=memory view=] in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] address space.
This includes the [=store type=] of a workgroup variable.

Note: A fixed-footprint type may contain an [=atomic type|atomic=] type, either directly or
indirectly, while a [=constructible=] type cannot.

Note: Fixed-footprint types exclude [=runtime-sized=] arrays, and any structure
that contains a [=runtime-sized=] array.

## Memory ## {#memory}

In WGSL, a value of [=storable=] type may be stored in memory, for later retrieval.
This section describes the structure of memory, and how WGSL types are used to
describe the contents of memory.

### Memory Locations ### {#memory-locations-section}

Memory consists of a set of distinct <dfn noexport>memory locations</dfn>.
Each memory location is 8-bits in size.
An operation affecting memory interacts with a set of one or more memory locations.
Memory operations on [=composites=] [=behavioral requirement|will=] not
access padding memory locations.

Two sets of memory locations <dfn noexport>overlap</dfn> if the intersection of
their sets of memory locations is non-empty.

### Memory Access Mode ### {#memory-access-mode}

A <dfn noexport>memory access</dfn> is an operation that acts on memory locations.

* A <dfn noexport>read access</dfn> observes the contents of memory locations.
* A <dfn noexport>write access</dfn> sets the contents of memory locations.

A single operation can read, write, or both read and write.

Particular memory locations may support only certain kinds of accesses, expressed
as the memory's <dfn noexport>access mode</dfn>:

: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">read</dfn>
:: Supports read accesses, but not writes.
: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">write</dfn>
:: Supports write accesses, but not reads.
: <dfn noexport dfn-for="access">read_write</dfn>
:: Supports both read and write accesses.

When a [=token=] matches the [=syntax/access_mode=] grammar nonterminal, it is considered a [=context-dependent name=].
In particular, the token does not [=resolve=] to any declared object.

### Storable Types ### {#storable-types}

The value contained in a [=variable=] [=shader-creation error|must=] be of a [=storable=] type.
A storable type may have an explicit representation defined by WGSL,
as described in [[#internal-value-layout]],
or it may be opaque, such as for [=texture resource|textures=] and [=sampler resource|samplers=].

A type is <dfn noexport>storable</dfn> if it is both [=type/concrete=] and one of:

* a [=scalar=] type
* a [=vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* an [=array=] type
* a [=structure=] type
* a [=texture=] type
* a [=sampler=] type

Note: That is, the storable types are the [=type/concrete=] [=plain types=], texture types, and sampler types.

### Host-shareable Types ### {#host-shareable-types}

Host-shareable types are used to describe the contents of buffers which are shared between
the host and the GPU, or copied between host and GPU without format translation.
When used for this purpose, the type may additionally have [=layout
attributes=] applied as described in [[#memory-layouts]].
We will see in [[#var-decls]] that the [=store type=] of [=uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=]
variables [=shader-creation error|must=] be host-shareable.

A type is <dfn noexport>host-shareable</dfn> if it is both [=type/concrete=] and one of:

* a [=numeric scalar=] type
* a [=numeric vector=] type
* a [=matrix=] type
* an [=atomic type|atomic=] type
* a [=fixed-size array=] type, if it has [=creation-fixed footprint=] and its element type is host-shareable
* a [=runtime-sized=] array type, if its element type is host-shareable
* a [=structure=] type, if all its members are host-shareable

Note: Many types are host-shareable, but not IO-shareable, including [=atomic types=],
[=runtime-sized=] arrays, and any composite types containing them.

Note: Both IO-shareable and host-shareable types have specified sizes, but counted differently.
IO-shareable types are sized by a location-count metric, see [[#input-output-locations]].
Host-shareable types are sized by a byte-count metric, see [[#memory-layouts]].

### Address Spaces ### {#address-space}

Memory locations are partitioned into <dfn noexport>address spaces</dfn>.
Each address space has unique properties determining
mutability, visibility, the values it may contain,
and how to use variables with it.
See [[#var-and-value]] for more details.

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Address Spaces</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Address space
        <th>Sharing among invocations
        <th>Notes
  </thead>
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">function</dfn>
      <td>Same invocation only
      <td>
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">private</dfn>
      <td>Same invocation only
      <td>
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">workgroup</dfn>
      <td>Invocations in the same [=compute shader stage|compute shader=] [=compute shader stage/workgroup=]
      <td>The [=element count=] of an outermost array may be a [=pipeline-overridable=] constant.
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">uniform</dfn>
      <td>Invocations in the same [=shader stage=]
      <td>For [=uniform buffer=] variables
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">storage</dfn>
      <td>Invocations in the same [=shader stage=]
      <td>For [=storage buffer=] variables
  <tr><td><dfn noexport dfn-for="address spaces">handle</dfn>
      <td>Invocations in the same shader stage
      <td>For [=sampler resource|sampler=] and [=texture resource|texture=] variables.<br>
</table>

When a [=token=] matches the [=syntax/address_space=] grammar nonterminal, it is considered a [=context-dependent name=].
In particular, the token does not [=resolve=] to any declared object.

Note: The token `handle` is reserved: it is never used in a WGSL program.

### Memory Layout ### {#memory-layouts}

[=Uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=] variables are used to share
bulk data organized as a sequence of bytes in memory.
Buffers are shared between the CPU and the GPU, or between different shader stages
in a pipeline, or between different pipelines.

Because buffer data are shared without reformatting or translation, it is a
[=dynamic error=] if buffer producers and consumers do not agree on the <dfn
noexport>memory layout</dfn>, which is the description of how the bytes in a
buffer are organized into typed WGSL values.

The [=store type=] of a buffer variable [=shader-creation error|must=] be
[=host-shareable=], with fully elaborated memory layout, as described below.

Each buffer variable [=shader-creation error|must=] be declared in either the
[=address spaces/uniform=] or [=address spaces/storage=] address spaces.

The memory layout of a type is significant only when evaluating an expression with:
* a variable in the [=address spaces/uniform=] or [=address spaces/storage=] address space, or
* a pointer into the [=address spaces/uniform=] or [=address spaces/storage=] address space.

An 8-bit byte is the most basic unit of [=host-shareable=] memory.
The terms defined in this section express counts of 8-bit bytes.

We will use the following notation:
* <dfn noexport>AlignOf</dfn>(|T|) is the [=alignment=] of host-shareable type |T|.
* <dfn noexport>AlignOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |i|) is the alignment of the |i|'th member of the host-shareable structure |S|.
* <dfn noexport>SizeOf</dfn>(|T|) is the [=byte-size=] of host-shareable type |T|.
* <dfn noexport>SizeOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |i|) is the size of the |i|'th member of the host-shareable structure |S|.
* <dfn noexport>OffsetOfMember</dfn>(|S|, |i|) is the offset of the |i|'th member from the start of the host-shareable structure |S|.
* <dfn noexport>StrideOf</dfn>(|A|) is the <dfn>element stride</dfn> of host-shareable array type |A|, defined
    as the number of bytes from the start of one array element to the start of the next element.
    It equals the size of the array's element type, rounded up to the alignment of the element type:
        <p algorithm="array element stride">
          [=StrideOf=](array<|E|, |N|>) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOf=](E), [=SizeOf=](E))<br>
          [=StrideOf=](array<|E|>) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOf=](E), [=SizeOf=](E))
        </p>


#### Alignment and Size ####  {#alignment-and-size}

Each [=host-shareable=] data type |T| has an alignment and size.

The <dfn>alignment</dfn> of a type is a constraint on where values of that type may be placed in memory, expressed
as an integer:
a type's alignment [=shader-creation error|must=] evenly divide
the byte address of the starting [=memory location=] of a value of that type.
Alignments enable use of more efficient hardware instructions for accessing the values,
or satisfy more restrictive hardware requirements on certain
address spaces. (See [address space layout constraints](#address-space-layout-constraints)).

Note: Each alignment value is always a power of two, by construction.

The <dfn>byte-size</dfn> of a type or structure member is the number of contiguous bytes
reserved in host-shareable memory for the purpose of storing a value of the type
or structure member.
The size may include non-addressable padding at the end of the type.
Consequently, loads and stores of a value might access fewer memory locations
than the value's size.

Alignment and size for host-shareable types are defined recursively in the
following table:

#### Structure Member Layout ####  {#structure-member-layout}

The internal layout of a [=structure=] is computed from the sizes and alignments of its members.
By default, the members are arranged tightly, in order, without overlap, while satisfying member alignment
requirements.

This default internal layout can be overriden by using <dfn noexport>layout attributes</dfn>, which are:

* [=attribute/size=]
* [=attribute/align=]

The |i|'th member of structure type |S| has a size and alignment, denoted
by [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, |i|) and [=AlignOfMember=](|S|, |i|), respectively.
The member sizes and alignments are used to calculate each member's byte offset from the start of the structure,
as described in [[#internal-value-layout]].

<p algorithm="structure member size">
  [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, |i|) is |k| if the |i|'th member of |S| has attribute [=attribute/size=](|k|).
  Otherwise, it is [=SizeOf=](|T|) where |T| is the type of the member.
</p>

<p algorithm="structure member alignment">
  [=AlignOfMember=](|S|, |i|) is |k| if the |i|'th member of |S| has attribute [=attribute/align=](|k|).
  Otherwise, it is [=AlignOf=](|T|) where |T| is the type of the member.
</p>

If a structure member has the [=attribute/size=] attribute applied, the
value [=shader-creation error|must=] be at least as large as the size of the
member's type:

<p algorithm="member size constraint">
  [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, |i|) &ge; [=SizeOf=](T)<br>
  Where |T| is the type of the |i|'th member of |S|.
</p>

The first structure member always has a zero byte offset from the start of the
structure:
<p algorithm="offset of first structure member">
  [=OffsetOfMember=](<var ignore>S</var>, 1) = 0
</p>

Each subsequent member is placed at the lowest offset that satisfies the member type alignment,
and which avoids overlap with the previous member.
For each member index |i| > 1:
<p algorithm="structure member offset">
  [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, |i|) = [=roundUp=]([=AlignOfMember=](|S|, |i| ), [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, |i|-1) + [=SizeOfMember=](|S|, |i|-1))<br>
</p>

#### Internal Layout of Values ####  {#internal-value-layout}

This section describes how the internals of a value are placed in the byte locations
of a buffer, given an assumed placement of the overall value.
These layouts depend on the value's type,
and the [=attribute/align=] and [=attribute/size=] attributes on structure members.

The buffer byte offset at which a value is placed [=shader-creation
error|must=] satisfy the type alignment requirement: If a value of type |T| is
placed at buffer offset |k|, then |k| = |c| &times; [=AlignOf=](|T|), for some
non-negative integer |c|.

The data [=behavioral requirement|will=] appear identically regardless of the address space.

When a value |V| of type [=u32=] or [=i32=] is placed at byte offset |k| of a
host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+2 contains bits 16 through 23 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+3 contains bits 24 through 31 of |V|

Note: Recall that [=i32=] uses twos-complement representation, so the sign bit
is in bit position 31.

A value |V| of type [=f32=] is represented in [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary32 format.
It has one sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23 fraction bits.
When |V| is placed at byte offset |k| of host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of the fraction.
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of the fraction.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+2 contain bits 16 through 22 of the fraction.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+2 contains bit 0 of the exponent.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+3 contain bits 1 through 7 of the exponent.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+3 contains the sign bit.

A value |V| of type [=f16=] is represented in [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] binary16 format.
It has one sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 fraction bits.
When |V| is placed at byte offset |k| of host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of the fraction.
   * Bits 0 through 1 of byte |k|+1 contain bits 8 through 9 of the fraction.
   * Bits 2 through 6 of byte |k|+1 contain bits 0 through 4 of the exponent.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+1 contains the sign bit.

Note: The above rules imply that numeric values in host-shared buffers
are stored in little-endian format.

When a value |V| of [=atomic type=] `atomic`&lt;|T|&gt; is placed in a host-shared buffer,
it has the same internal layout as a value of the underlying type |T|.

When a value |V| of [=vector|vector type=] vec|N|&lt;|T|&gt; is placed at
byte offset |k| of a host-shared buffer, then:
   * |V|.x is placed at byte offset |k|
   * |V|.y is placed at byte offset |k| + [=SizeOf=](|T|)
   * If |N| &ge; 3, then |V|.z is placed at byte offset |k| + 2 &times; [=SizeOf=](|T|)
   * If |N| &ge; 4, then |V|.w is placed at byte offset |k| + 3 &times; [=SizeOf=](|T|)

When a value |V| of [=matrix|matrix type=] mat|C|x|R|&lt;|T|&gt; is placed at
byte offset |k| of a host-shared buffer, then:
  * Column vector |i| of |V| is placed at byte offset |k| + |i| &times; [=AlignOf=](vec|R|&lt;|T|&gt;)

When a value of [=array|array type=] |A| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * Element |i| of the array is placed at byte offset |k| + |i| &times; [=StrideOf=](|A|)

When a value of [=structure|structure type=] |S| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * The |i|'<sup>th</sup> member of the structure value is placed at byte offset |k| + [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|,|i|).
    See [[#structure-member-layout]].

#### Address Space Layout Constraints ####  {#address-space-layout-constraints}

The [=address spaces/storage=] and [=address spaces/uniform=] address spaces
have different buffer layout constraints which are described in this section.

All structure and array types directly or indirectly referenced by a variable
[=shader-creation error|must=] obey the constraints of the variable's address space.
Violations of an address space constraint results in a [=shader-creation error=].

In this section we define <dfn noexport>RequiredAlignOf</dfn>(|S|, |C|) as the
byte offset [=alignment=] requirement of values of host-shareable type |S| when
used in address space |C|.

      <td>[=roundUp=](16, [=AlignOf=](|S|))<br>
</table>

Structure members of type |T| [=shader-creation error|must=] have a byte offset
from the start of the structure that is a multiple of the [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|)
for the address space |C|:

<p algorithm="structure member minimum alignment">
    [=OffsetOfMember=](|S|, |M|) = |k| &times; [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, C)<br>
    Where |k| is a positive integer and |M| is a member of structure |S| with type |T|
</p>

Arrays of element type |T| [=shader-creation error|must=] have an [=element stride=] that is a
multiple of the [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) for the address space |C|:

<p algorithm="array element minimum alignment">
    [=StrideOf=](array<|T|, |N|>) = |k| &times; [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, C)<br>
    [=StrideOf=](array<|T|>) = |k| &times; [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, C)<br>
    Where |k| is a positive integer
</p>

Note: [=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) does not impose any additional restrictions
on the values permitted for an [=attribute/align=] attribute, nor does it affect the rules
of [=AlignOf=](|T|). Data is laid out with the rules defined in previous
sections and then the resulting layout is validated against the
[=RequiredAlignOf=](|T|, |C|) rules.

The [=address spaces/uniform=] address space also requires that:
* Array elements are aligned to 16 byte boundaries.
    That is, [=StrideOf=](array&lt;|T|,|N|&gt;) = 16 &times; |k|' for some positive integer |k|'.
* If a structure member itself has a structure type `S`, then the number of
    bytes between the start of that member and the start of any following member
    [=shader-creation error|must=] be at least [=roundUp=](16, [=SizeOf=](S)).

Note: The following examples show how to use [=attribute/align=] and [=attribute/size=] attributes
on structure members to satisfy layout requirements for uniform buffers.

## Memory Views ## {#memory-views}

In addition to calculating with [=plain types|plain=] values, a WGSL program will
also often read values from memory or write values to memory, via [=memory access=] operations.
Each memory access is performed via a [=memory view=].

A <dfn noexport>memory view</dfn> comprises:
* a set of [=memory locations=] in a particular [=address space=],
* a [[#memory-model-reference|memory model reference]],
* an interpretation of the contents of those locations as a WGSL [=type=], known as the <dfn noexport>store type</dfn>, and
* an [=access mode=].

The access mode of a memory view [=shader-creation error|must=] be supported by the address space. See [[#address-space]].

### Reference and Pointer Types ### {#ref-ptr-types}

WGSL has two kinds of types for representing [=memory views=]:
[=reference types=] and [=pointer types=].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Constraint<th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="memory reference type">
    <td style="width:25%">|AS| is an [=address space=],<br>|T| is a [=storable=] type,<br>|AM| is an [=access mode=]
    <td>ref&lt;|AS|,|T|,|AM|&gt;
    <td>The <dfn noexport>reference type</dfn>
        identified with the set of [=memory views=] for memory locations in |AS| holding values of type |T|,
        supporting memory accesses described by mode |AM|.

        Here, |T| is the [=store type=].

        Reference types are not written in WGSL program source;
        instead they are used to analyze a WGSL program.
  <tr algorithm="pointer type">
    <td>|AS| is an [=address space=],<br>|T| is a [=storable=] type,<br>|AM| is an [=access mode=]
    <td>ptr&lt;|AS|,|T|,|AM|&gt;
    <td>The <dfn noexport>pointer type</dfn>
        identified with the set of [=memory views=] for memory locations in |AS| holding values of type |T|,
        supporting memory accesses described by mode |AM|.

        Here, |T| is the [=store type=].

        Pointer types may appear in WGSL program source.
</table>

Two pointer types are the same if and only if they have the same address space, store type, and access mode.

When *analyzing* a WGSL program, reference and pointer types are fully parameterized by
an address space, a storable type, and an access mode.
In code examples in this specification, the comments show this fully parameterized form.

However, in WGSL *source* text:
* Reference types [=shader-creation error|must not=] appear.
* Pointer types may appear.
    * A pointer type is spelled with parameterization by:
        * [=address space=],
        * [=store type=], and
        * sometimes by [=access mode=], as specified in [[#access-mode-defaults]].
    * If a pointer type appears in the program source,
        it [=shader-creation error|must=] also be valid to [=variable declaration|declare a variable=],
        somewhere in the program,
        with the pointer type's [=address space=], [=store type=], and [=access mode=].

        Note: This restriction forbids the declaration of certain [=type aliases=]
        and function [=formal parameters=] that can never be used at runtime.
        Without the restriction, it would be valid to declare an alias to a pointer type,
        but never be able to create a pointer value of that type.
        Similarly, it would be valid to declare a function with a pointer formal parameter,
        but never be able to call that function.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Pointer type'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn my_function(
      /* 'ptr<function,i32,read_write>' is the type of a pointer value that references
         memory for keeping an 'i32' value, using memory locations in the 'function'
         address space.  Here 'i32' is the store type.
         The implied access mode is 'read_write'. See below for access mode defaults. */
      ptr_int: ptr<function,i32>,

      // 'ptr<private,array<f32,50>,read_write>' is the type of a pointer value that
      // refers to memory for keeping an array of 50 elements of type 'f32', using
      // memory locations in the 'private' address space.
      // Here the store type is 'array<f32,50>'.
      // The implied access mode is 'read_write'. See below for access mode defaults.
      ptr_array: ptr<private, array<f32, 50>>
    ) { }
  </xmp>
</div>

Reference types and pointer types are both sets of memory views:
a particular memory view is associated with a unique reference value and also a unique pointer value:

<blockquote algorithm="pointer reference correspondence">
Each pointer value |p| of type ptr&lt;|AS|,|T|,|AM|&gt; corresponds to a unique reference value |r| of type ref&lt;|AS|,|T|,|AM|&gt;,
and vice versa,
where |p| and |r| describe the same memory view.
</blockquote>

### Access Mode Defaults ### {#access-mode-defaults}

The access mode for a memory view is often determined by context:


The [=address spaces/storage=] address spaces supports both [=access/read=] and
[=access/read_write=] access modes.
Each other address space supports only one access mode.
The default access mode for each address space is described in the following
table.

<table class='data'>
<caption>
  Access Mode Defaults.
</caption>
<thead>
  <tr><th>Address Space
      <td>Default Access Mode
</thead>
<tr><td>[=address spaces/function=]
    <td>[=access/read_write=]
<tr><td>[=address spaces/private=]
    <td>[=access/read_write=]
<tr><td>[=address spaces/workgroup=]
    <td>[=access/read_write=]
<tr><td>[=address spaces/uniform=]
    <td>[=access/read=]
<tr><td>[=address spaces/storage=]
    <td>[=access/read=]
<tr><td>[=address spaces/handle=]
    <td>[=access/read=]
</table>

When writing a [=variable declaration=] or a [=pointer type=] in WGSL source:
* For the [=address spaces/storage=] address space, the access mode is optional, and defaults to [=access/read=].
* For other address spaces, the access mode [=shader-creation error|must not=] be written.

### Originating Variable ### {#originating-variable-section}

In WGSL a reference value always corresponds to the memory view
for some or all of the memory locations for some variable.
This defines the <dfn noexport>originating variable</dfn> for the reference value.

A pointer value always corresponds to a reference value, and so the originating variable
of a pointer is the same as the originating variable of the corresponding reference.

Note: The originating variable is a dynamic concept.
The originating variable for a formal parameter of a function depends on the
[=call site|call sites=] for the function.
Different call sites may supply pointers into different originating variables.

### Invalid Memory Reference ### {#invalid-mem-reference}

If a reference or pointer access is out of bounds, an
<dfn noexport>invalid memory reference</dfn> is produced.
[=Load Rule|Loads=] from an invalid reference return one of:
    * when the [=originating variable=] is a [=uniform buffer=] or a [=storage buffer=],
        the value from any [=memory locations|memory location(s)=]
        of the WebGPU {{GPUBuffer}} bound to the originating variable
    * when the originating variable is not a [=uniform buffer=] or [=storage buffer=],
        a value from any [=memory locations|memory location(s)=] in the originating variable
    * the [=zero value=] for store type of the reference
    * if the loaded value is a vector, the value (0, 0, 0, x), where x is:
        * 0, 1, or the maximum positive value for integer components
        * 0.0 or 1.0 for floating-point components
[=statement/assignment|Stores=] to an invalid reference may do one of:
    * when the [=originating variable=] is a [=uniform buffer=] or a [=storage buffer=],
        store the value to any [=memory locations|memory location(s)=] of the
        WebGPU {{GPUBuffer}} bound to the [=originating variable=]
    * when the [=originating variable=] is not a [=uniform buffer=] or [=storage buffer=],
        store the value to any [=memory locations|memory locations(s)=] in the
        originating variable
    * not be executed
It is a [=dynamic error=] if [[#atomic-rmw|read-modify-write atomics]] that
operate on an invalid memory reference load and store from different [=memory
locations|memory locations=] if they access memory.

### Use Cases for References and Pointers ### {#ref-ptr-use-cases}

References and pointers are distinguished by how they are used:

* The type of a [=variable=] is a reference type.
* The [=address-of=] operation (unary `&`) converts a reference value to its corresponding pointer value.
* The [=indirection=] operation (unary `*`) converts a pointer value to its corresponding reference value.
* A [=let-declaration=] can be of pointer type, but not of reference type.
* A [=formal parameter=] can be of pointer type, but not of reference type.
* A [=simple assignment=] statement performs a [=write access=] to update the contents of memory via a reference, where:
    * The [=left-hand side=] of the assignment statement [=shader-creation error|must=] be of reference type, with access mode [=access/write=] or [=access/read_write=].
    * The [=right-hand side=] of the assignment statement [=shader-creation error|must=] evaluate to the store type of the left-hand side.
* The <dfn noexport>Load Rule</dfn>: Inside a function, a reference is automatically dereferenced (read from) to satisfy type rules:
    * In a function, when a reference expression |r| with store type |T| is used in a statement or an expression, where
    * |r| has an access mode of [=access/read=] or [=access/read_write=], and
    * The only potentially matching type rules require |r| to have a value of type |T|, then
    * That type rule requirement is considered to have been met, and
    * The result of evaluating |r| in that context is the value (of type |T|) stored in the memory locations
        referenced by |r| at the time of evaluation.
        That is, a [=read access=] is performed to produce the result value.

Defining references in this way enables simple idiomatic use of variables:

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Reference types enable simple use of variables'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @compute @workgroup_size(1)
    fn main() {
      // 'i' has reference type ref<function,i32,read_write>
      // The memory locations for 'i' store the i32 value 0.
      var i: i32 = 0;

      // 'i + 1' can only match a type rule where the 'i' subexpression is of type i32.
      // So the expression 'i + 1' has type i32, and at evaluation, the 'i' subexpression
      // evaluates to the i32 value stored in the memory locations for 'i' at the time
      // of evaluation.
      let one: i32 = i + 1;

      // Update the value in the locations referenced by 'i' so they hold the value 2.
      i = one + 1;

      // Update the value in the locations referenced by 'i' so they hold the value 5.
      // The evaluation of the right-hand-side occurs before the assignment takes effect.
      i = i + 3;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Returning a reference returns the value loaded via the reference'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var<private> age: i32;
    fn get_age() -> i32 {
      // The type of the expression in the return statement must be 'i32' since it
      // must match the declared return type of the function.
      // The 'age' expression is of type ref<private,i32,read_write>.
      // Apply the Load Rule, since the store type of the reference matches the
      // required type of the expression, and no other type rule applies.
      // The evaluation of 'age' in this context is the i32 value loaded from the
      // memory locations referenced by 'age' at the time the return statement is
      // executed.
      return age;
    }

    fn caller() {
      age = 21;
      // The copy_age constant will get the i32 value 21.
      let copy_age: i32 = get_age();
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

Defining pointers in this way enables two key use cases:

* Using a let-declaration with pointer type, to form a short name for part of the contents of a variable.
* Using a formal parameter of a function to refer to the memory of a variable that is accessible to the [=calling function=].
    * The call to such a function [=shader-creation error|must=] supply a pointer value for that operand.
        This often requires using an [=address-of=] operation (unary `&`) to get a pointer to the variable's contents.

Note: The following examples use WGSL features explained later in this specification.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Using a pointer as a short name for part of a variable'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct Particle {
      position: vec3<f32>,
      velocity: vec3<f32>

      timestep: f32,
      particles: array<Particle,100>
    }

    @compute @workgroup_size(1)

      let current_position: vec3<f32>  = (*active_particle).position;

         On the left-hand side, unary '*' converts the pointer to a reference that
         can then be assigned to. It has a read_write access mode, by default.
         /* On the right-hand side:

### Forming Reference and Pointer Values ### {#forming-references-and-pointers}

A reference value is formed in one of the following ways:

* The [=identifier=] [=resolves|resolving=] to an [=in scope|in-scope=] variable *v* denotes the reference value for *v*'s memory.
    * The resolved variable is the [=originating variable=] for the reference.
* Use the [=indirection=] (unary `*`) operation on a pointer.
    * The originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the pointer.
* Use a <dfn noexport>composite reference component expression</dfn>.
    In each case the originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the
    original reference.
    * Given a reference with a [=vector=] store type, appending a single-letter vector access phrase
        results in a reference to the named component of the vector.
        See [[#component-reference-from-vector-reference]].
    * Given a reference with a [=vector=] store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed component of the vector.
        See [[#component-reference-from-vector-reference]].
    * Given a reference with a [=matrix=] store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed column vector of the matrix.
        See [[#matrix-access-expr]].
    * Given a reference with an [=array=] store type, appending an array index access phrase
        results in a reference to the indexed element of the array.
        See [[#array-access-expr]].
    * Given a reference with a [=structure=] store type, appending a member access phrase
        results in a reference to the named member of the structure.
        See [[#struct-access-expr]].

In all cases, the [=access mode=] of the result is the same as the access mode of the original reference.

    fn f() {
        var uv: vec2<f32>;
        // For the remainder of this function body, 'uv' denotes the reference

A pointer value is formed in one of the following ways:

* Use the [=address-of=] (unary `&`) operator on a reference.
    * The originating variable of the result is defined as the originating variable of the reference.
* If a function [=formal parameter=] has pointer type, then when the function is invoked
    at runtime the uses of the formal parameter denote the pointer value
    provided to the corresponding operand at the [=call site=] in the [=calling function=].
    * The originating variable of the formal parameter (at runtime) is defined as
        the originating variable of the pointer operand at the call site.

In all cases, the access mode of the result is the same as the access mode of the original pointer.

### Comparison with References and Pointers in Other Languages ### {#pointers-other-languages}

This section is informative, not normative.

References and pointers in WGSL are more restricted than in other languages.
In particular:

* In WGSL a reference can't directly be declared as an alias to another reference or variable,
    either as a variable or as a formal parameter.
* In WGSL pointers and references are not [=storable=].
    That is, the content of a WGSL [=variable declaration=] may not contain a pointer or a reference.
* In WGSL a function [=shader-creation error|must not=] return a pointer or reference.
* In WGSL there is no way to convert between integer values and pointer values.
* In WGSL there is no way to forcibly change the type of a pointer value into another pointer type.
    * A composite component reference expression is different:
        it takes a reference to a composite value and yields a reference to
        one of the components or elements inside the composite value.
        These are considered different references in WGSL, even though they may
        have the same machine address at a lower level of implementation abstraction.
* In WGSL there is no way to forcibly change the type of a reference value into another reference type.
* In WGSL there is no way to change the access mode of a pointer or reference.
    * By comparison, C++ automatically converts a non-const pointer to a const pointer,
        and has a `const_cast` to convert a const value to a non-const value.
* In WGSL there is no way to allocate new memory from a "heap".
* In WGSL there is no way to explicitly destroy a variable.
    The memory for a WGSL variable becomes inaccessible only when the variable goes out of scope.

Note: From the above rules, it is not possible to form a "dangling" pointer,
i.e. a pointer that does not reference the memory for a valid (or "live")
originating variable.

## Texture and Sampler Types ## {#texture-sampler-types}

A <dfn noexport>texel</dfn> is a scalar or vector used as the smallest independently accessible element of a [=texture=].
The word *texel* is short for *texture element*.

A <dfn noexport>texture</dfn> is a collection of texels supporting special operations useful for rendering.
In WGSL, those operations are invoked via texture builtin functions.
See [[#texture-builtin-functions]] for a complete list.

A WGSL texture corresponds to a WebGPU {{GPUTexture}}.

A texture is either arrayed, or non-arrayed:

* A <dfn noexport>non-arrayed texture</dfn> is a grid of texels. Each texel has a unique grid coordinate.
* An <dfn noexport>arrayed texture</dfn> is a homogeneous array of grids of texels.
    In an arrayed texture, each texel is identified with its unique combination of array index and grid coordinate.

A texture has the following features:

: texel format
:: The data in each texel. See [[#texel-formats]].
:  dimensionality
:: The number of dimensions in the grid coordinates, and how the coordinates are interpreted.
    The number of dimensions is 1, 2, or 3.
    Most textures use cartesian coordinates.
    Cube textures have six square faces, and are sampled with
    a three dimensional coordinate interpreted as a direction vector from the origin toward
    the cube centered on the origin.
: size
:: The extent of grid coordinates along each dimension.
: mip level count
:: The mip level count is at least 1 for sampled textures, and equal to 1 for storage textures.<br>
    <dfn>Mip level</dfn> 0 contains a full size version of the texture.
    Each successive mip level contains a filtered version of the previous mip level
    at half the size (within rounding) of the previous mip level.<br>
    When sampling a texture, an explicit or implicitly-computed level-of-detail is used
    to select the mip levels from which to read texel data.  These are then combined via
    filtering to produce the sampled value.
: arrayed
:: whether the texture is arrayed.
: <dfn noexport>array size</dfn>
:: the number of homogeneous grids, if the texture is arrayed

A texture's representation is typically optimized for rendering operations.
To achieve this, many details are hidden from the programmer, including data layouts, data types, and
internal operations that cannot be expressed directly in the shader language.

As a consequence, a shader does not have direct access to the texel memory within a [=texture resource|texture variable=].
Instead, access is mediated through an opaque handle:

* Within the shader:
    * Declare a module-scope variable
        where the [=store type=] is one of the texture types described in later sections.
        The variable stores an opaque handle to the underlying texture memory, and is
        automatically placed in the [=address spaces/handle=] address space.
    * Inside a function, call one of the texture builtin functions, and provide
        the texture variable or function parameter as the builtin function's
        first parameter.
* When constructing the WebGPU pipeline, the texture variable's store type and binding
    [=shader-creation error|must=] be compatible with the corresponding bind group layout entry.

In this way, the set of supported operations for a texture type
is determined by the availability of texture builtin functions having
a [=formal parameter=] with that texture type.

Note: The handle stored by a texture variable cannot be changed by the shader.
That is, the variable is read-only, even if the underlying texture to which it provides
access may be mutable (e.g. a write-only storage texture).

The <dfn>texture types</dfn> are the set of types defined in:
* [[#sampled-texture-type]]
* [[#multisampled-texture-type]]
* [[#external-texture-type]]
* [[#texture-depth]]

A [=sampler=] is an opaque handle that controls how [=texel|texels=] are accessed
from a sampled texture.

A WGSL sampler maps to a WebGPU {{GPUSampler}}.

Texel access is controlled via several properties of the sampler:

: addressing mode
:: Controls how texture boundaries and out-of-bounds
    coordinates are resolved.
    The addressing mode for each texture dimension can be set independently.
    See WebGPU {{GPUAddressMode}}.
: filter mode
:: Controls which texels are accessed to produce the final result.
    Filtering can either use the nearest texel or interpolate between multiple
    texels.
    Multiple filter modes can be set independently.
    See WebGPU {{GPUFilterMode}}.
: LOD clamp
:: Controls the min and max levels of details that are accessed.
: comparison
:: Controls the type of comparison done for [=type/sampler_comparison|comparison sampler=].
    See WebGPU {{GPUCompareFunction}}.
: max anisotropy
:: Controls the maximum anisotropy value used by the sampler.

Samplers cannot be created in WGSL programs and their state (e.g. the
properties listed above) are immutable within a shader and can only be set by
the WebGPU API.

It is a [=pipeline-creation error=] if a filtering sampler (i.e. any sampler
using interpolative filtering) is used with texture that has a non-filterable
format.

Note: The handle stored by a sampler variable cannot be changed by the shader.

### Texel Formats ### {#texel-formats}

In WGSL, certain texture types are parameterized by texel format.

A <dfn noexport>texel format</dfn> is characterized by:

: <dfn noexport>channels</dfn>
:: Each channel contains a scalar.
    A texel format has up to four channels: `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a`,
    normally corresponding to the concepts of red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
: <dfn noexport>channel format</dfn>
:: The number of bits in the channel, and how those bits are interpreted.

Each texel format in WGSL corresponds to a WebGPU {{GPUTextureFormat}}
with the same name.

Only certain texel formats are used in WGSL source code.
The channel formats used to define those texel formats are listed in the
<dfn dfn>Channel Formats</dfn> table.
The last column specifies the conversion from the stored channel bits to the value used in the shader.
This is also known as the <dfn noexport>channel transfer function</dfn>, or CTF.

Note: The channel transfer function for 8unorm maps {0,...,255} to the floating point interval [0.0, 1.0].

Note: The channel transfer function for 8snorm maps {-128,...,127} to the floating point interval [-1.0, 1.0].

</table>

The texel formats listed in the
<dfn lt="storage-texel-formats">Texel Formats for Storage Textures</dfn> table
correspond to the [[WebGPU#plain-color-formats|WebGPU plain color formats]]
which support the WebGPU {{GPUTextureUsage/STORAGE_BINDING}} usage.
These texel formats are used to parameterize the storage texture types defined
in [[#texture-storage]].

When the texel format does not have all four channels, then:

* When reading the texel:
    * If the texel format has no green channel, then the second component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no blue channel, then the third component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no alpha channel, then the fourth component of the shader value is 1.
* When writing the texel, shader value components for missing channels are ignored.

The last column in the table below uses the format-specific
[=channel transfer function=] from the [=channel formats=] table.

### Sampled Texture Types ### {#sampled-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_1d<type>`
`texture_2d<type>`
`texture_2d_array<type>`
`texture_3d<type>`
`texture_cube<type>`
`texture_cube_array<type>`
</pre>
* type [=shader-creation error|must=] be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`
* The parameterized type for the images is the type after conversion from sampling.
    E.g. you can have an image with texels with 8bit unorm components, but when you sample
    them you get a 32-bit float result (or vec-of-f32).

### Multisampled Texture Types ### {#multisampled-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_multisampled_2d<type>`
</pre>
* type [=shader-creation error|must=] be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`

### External Sampled Texture Types ### {#external-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_external`
</pre>

`texture_external` is an opaque 2d float-sampled texture type similar to `texture_2d<f32>`
but potentially with a different representation.
It can be read using [[#textureload|textureLoad]] or [[#textureSampleBaseClampToEdge|textureSampleBaseClampToEdge]] built-in functions,
which handle these different representations opaquely.

See [[WebGPU#gpu-external-texture]].

### Storage Texture Types ### {#texture-storage}

A <dfn noexport>storage texture</dfn> supports accessing a single texel without the use of a sampler.

* A <dfn noexport>write-only storage texture</dfn>
     supports writing a single texel, with automatic conversion of the shader value to a
     stored texel value.

A storage texture type [=shader-creation error|must=] be parameterized by one of the
[=storage-texel-format|texel formats for storage textures=].
The texel format determines the conversion function as specified in [[#texel-formats]].

For a write-only storage texture the *inverse* of the conversion function is used to convert the shader value to
the stored texel.

See [[#texture-builtin-functions]].

TODO(dneto): Move description of the conversion to the builtin function that actually does the reading.

<pre class='def'>
`texture_storage_1d<texel_format,access>`
`texture_storage_2d<texel_format,access>`
`texture_storage_2d_array<texel_format,access>`
`texture_storage_3d<texel_format,access>`
</pre>

* `texel_format` is a [=context-dependent name=] and [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of the texel types specified in [=storage-texel-formats=]
* `access` is a [=context-dependent name=] and [=shader-creation error|must=] be [=access/write=].

### Depth Texture Types ### {#texture-depth}
<pre class='def'>
`texture_depth_2d`
`texture_depth_2d_array`
`texture_depth_cube`
`texture_depth_cube_array`
`texture_depth_multisampled_2d`
</pre>

### Sampler Type ### {#sampler-type}

A <dfn>sampler</dfn> mediates access to a sampled texture or a depth texture, by performing a combination of:
* coordinate transformation.
* optionally modifying mip-level selection.
* for a sampled texture, optionally filtering retrieved texel values.
* for a depth texture, determining the comparison function applied to the retrieved texel.

A <dfn noexport>sampler types</dfn> are:
* [=type/sampler=]
* [=type/sampler_comparison=]

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="sampler type">
    <td><dfn dfn-for="type">sampler</dfn>

  <tr algorithm="comparison sampler type">
    <td><dfn dfn-for="type">sampler_comparison</dfn>
    <td>Comparison sampler.
        Mediates access to a depth texture.</td>

Samplers are parameterized when created in the WebGPU API.
They cannot be modified by a WGSL program.

Samplers can only be used by the [[#texture-builtin-functions|texture builtin functions]].

[=variable declaration|Variable=] and [=value declaration|value=] declarations
provide names for data values.

A <dfn noexport>value declaration</dfn> creates a name for a value, and that
value is immutable once it has been declared.
The four kinds of value declarations are `const`, `override`, `let`, and formal parameter declarations,
further described below (see [[#value-decls]]).

A <dfn noexport>variable declaration</dfn> creates a name for [=memory locations=]
for storing a value; the value stored there may be updated, if the variable has
a [=access/read_write=] access mode.
There is one kind of variable declaration, `var`, but it has options for
[=address space=] and [=access modes=] in various combinations, described
below (see [[#var-decls]]).

Note: A value declaration does not have associated memory locations. For
example, no WGSL expression can form a pointer to the value.

A declaration appearing outside of any function definition is at [=module scope=].
Its name is [=in scope=] for the entire program.

A declaration appearing within a function definition is in <dfn
noexport>function scope</dfn>.
The name is available for use in the statement immediately after its
declaration until the end of the brace-delimited list of statements immediately
enclosing the declaration.
A function-scope declaration is a [=dynamic context=].

Variable and value declarations have a similar overall syntax:
<xmp highlight=rust>
  // Specific value declarations.
               const    name [: type]  = initializer ;
  [attribute]  override name [: type] [= initializer];
               let      name [: type]  = initializer ;

  // General variable form.
  [attribute]* var[<address_space[, access_mode]>] name [: type] [= initializer];

  // Specific variable declarations.
  // Function scope.
               var[<function>] name [: type] [= initializer];

  // Module scope.
               var<private>    name [: type] [= initializer];
               var<workgroup>  name : type;
  [attribute]+ var<uniform>    name : type;
  [attribute]+ var             name : texture_type;
  [attribute]+ var             name : sampler_type;
  [attribute]+ var<storage[, access_mode]> name : type;
</xmp>

Each such declaration [=shader-creation error|must=] have an explicitly
specified type or an initializer.
Both a type and an initializer may be specified.
Each such declaration determines the type for the associated data value, known
as the <dfn noexport>effective-value-type</dfn> for the declaration.
The effective-value-type of the declaration is:
* The declared type, if explicitly specified.
* Otherwise, if the initializer expression has type `T`:
    * For a `const` declaration, the effective-value-type is `T` itself.
    * For a `override`, `let`, or `var` declaration, the effective-value-type
        is the [=concretization=] of `T`.

Each kind of value or variable declaration may place additional constraints on
the form of the initializer expression, if present, and on the
effective-value-type.

1. Only [=const-declarations=] can be [=type/abstract=] types, and only when
    the type is not explicitly specified.
2. The type of the expression must be [=feasible automatic conversion|feasibly
    converted=] to the [=effective-value-type=].
3. If an initializer is not specified, a value must be provided at [=pipeline
    creation|pipeline-creation time=].
4. [=Override-declarations=] are part of the shader interface, but are not
    bound resources.
5. [=Atomic types=] can only appear in mutable storage buffers or workgroup
    variables.
6. The data in [[#texture-storage|storage textures]] with a [=access/write=]
    [=access mode=] is mutable, but can only be modified via
    [[#texturestore|textureStore]] built-in function.
    The variable itself cannot be modified.
7. The [=element count=] of the outermost [=array=] may be an
    [=override-expression=].
8. If there is no initializer, the variable is [=default initial value|default
    initialized=].

## Variables vs Values ## {#var-vs-value}

[=Variable declarations=] are the only mutable data in a WGSL program.
[=Value declarations=] are always immutable.
Variables can be the basis of [=reference type|reference=] and [=pointer
type|pointer=] values because variables have associated [=memory locations=],
whereas a value declaration cannot be the basis of a pointer or reference
value.

Using variables is generally more expensive than using value declarations,
because using a variable requires extra operations to [=read access|read=] or
[=write access|write=] to the [=memory locations=] associated with the variable.

Generally speaking, an author should prefer using declarations in the following
order, with the most preferred option listed first:
* [=const-declaration=]
* [=override-declaration=]
* [=let-declaration=]
* [=variable declaration=]

This will generally result in the best overall performance of a shader.

## Value Declarations ## {#value-decls}

When an [=identifier=] [=resolves=] to a [=value declaration=], the identifier
denotes that value.

WGSL provides multiple kinds of value declarations.
The value for each kind of declaration is fixed at a different point in the
[[#shader-lifecycle|shader lifecycle]].
The different kinds of value declarations and when their values are fixed are:
* [=const-declarations=], at [=shader module creation|shader-creation time=]
* [=override-declarations=], at [=pipeline creation|pipeline-creation time=]
* [=let-declarations=], when they are executed
* [=formal parameter=] declarations, when the associated [=function call=] argument is executed

Note: [=Formal parameters=] are described in [[#functions]].

### `const` Declarations ### {#const-decls}

A <dfn noexport>const-declaration</dfn> specifies a name for a data value that
is fixed at [=shader module creation|shader-creation time=].
Each const-declaration requires an initializer.
A const-declaration can be declared in [=module scope|module=] or [=function
scope|function=] scope.
The initializer expression [=shader-creation error|must=] be a
[=const-expression=].
The type of a const-declaration must be a [=type/concrete=] or
[=type/abstract=] [=constructible=] type.
const-declarations are the only declarations where the [=effective-value-type=]
may be [=type/abstract=].

Note: Since [=abstract numeric types=] cannot be spelled in WGSL, they can only
be used via type inference.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='const-declarations at module scope'>
  <xmp>
    const a = 4;                  // AbstractInt with a value of 4.
    const b : i32 = 4;            // i32 with a value of 4.
    const c : u32 = 4;            // u32 with a value of 4.
    const d : f32 = 4;            // f32 with a value of 4.
    const e = vec3(a, a, a);      // vec3 of AbstractInt with a value of (4, 4, 4).
    const f = 2.0;                // AbstractFloat with a value of 2.
    const g = mat2x2(a, f, a, f); // mat2x2 of AbstractFloat with a value of:
                                  // ((4.0, 2.0), (4.0, 2.0)).
                                  // The AbstractInt a converts to AbstractFloat.
                                  // An AbstractFloat cannot convert to AbstractInt.
    const h = array(a, f, a, f);  // array of AbstractFloat with 4 components:
                                  // (4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 2.0).
  </xmp>
</div>

### `override` Declarations ### {#override-decls}

An <dfn noexport>override-declaration</dfn> specifies a name for a
[=pipeline-overridable=] constant value.
The value of a <dfn noexport>pipeline-overridable</dfn> constant is fixed at
[=pipeline creation|pipeline-creation time=].
The value is one provided by the WebGPU pipeline-creation method, if
specified, and otherwise is the value of its [=concretization of a
value|concretized=] initializer expression.
The [=effective-value-type=] of an override-declaration must be a [=type/concrete=]
[=scalar=] type.

An initializer expression is optional.
If present, it must be an [=override-expression=] and represents the <dfn
noexport>pipeline-overridable constant default value</dfn>.
If no initializer is specified, it is a [=pipeline-creation error=] if a value
is not provided at pipeline-creation time.

If the declaration has an [=attribute/id=] attribute applied, the literal
operand is known as the <dfn noexport>pipeline constant ID</dfn>, and must be a
unique integer between 0 and 65535 inclusive.
That is, two override-declarations must not use the same pipeline constant ID.

The application can specify its own value for an override-declaration at
[=pipeline creation|pipeline-creation time=].
The pipeline creation API accepts a mapping from overridable constants to a
value of the constant’s type.
The constant is identified by a <dfn noexport>pipeline-overridable constant
identifier string</dfn>, which is the base-10 representation of the [=pipeline
constant ID=] if specified, and otherwise the declared [=name=] of the constant.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Module constants, pipeline-overrideable'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @id(0)    override has_point_light: bool = true;  // Algorithmic control
    @id(1200) override specular_param: f32 = 2.3;     // Numeric control
    @id(1300) override gain: f32;                     // Must be overridden
              override width: f32 = 0.0;              // Specified at the API level using
                                                      // the name "width".
              override depth: f32;                    // Specified at the API level using
                                                      // the name "depth".
                                                      // Must be overridden.
              override height = 2 * depth;            // The default value
                                                      // (if not set at the API level),
                                                      // depends on another
                                                      // overridable constant.

  </xmp>
</div>


### `let` Declarations ### {#let-decls}

A <dfn noexport>let-declaration</dfn> specifies a name for a value that is
fixed each time the statement is executed at runtime.
A let-declaration must only be declared in [=function scope=], and as such, is
a [=dynamic context=].
A let-declaration must have an initializer expression.
The value is the [=concretization of a value|concretized=] value of the initializer.
The [=effective-value-type=] of a let-declaration must be either a [=type/concrete=]
[=constructible=] type or a [=pointer type=].

<div class='example wgsl let-declaration at function-scope' heading='let-declared constants at function scope'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // 'blockSize' denotes the i32 value 1024.
    let blockSize: i32 = 1024;

    // 'row_size' denotes the u32 value 16u.  The type is inferred.
    let row_size = 16u;
  </xmp>
</div>

## `var` Declarations ## {#var-decls}

A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a named reference to memory that can contain a value
of a particular [=storable=] type.

Two types are associated with a variable: its [=store type=] (the type of value
that may be placed in the referenced memory) and its [=reference type=] (the type
of the variable itself).
If a variable has store type `T`, [=address space=] `AS`, and [=access mode=]
`AM`, then its reference type is `ref<AS,T,AM>`.
The store type of a variable is always [=type/concrete=].

A variable declaration:
* Specifies the variable’s [=name=].
* Determines the variable’s [=address space=], [=store type=], and [=access mode=].
    Together these comprise the variable’s [=reference type=].
    * The store type is the [=effective-value-type=] of the variable’s declaration.
* Ensures the execution environment allocates memory for a value of the store
    type, in the specified address space, supporting the given access mode, for
    the [=lifetime=] of the variable.
* Optionally has an initializer expression if the variable is in the [=address
    spaces/private=] or [=address spaces/function=] address spaces.
    If present, the initializer must evaluate to the variable’s store type.
    If present, the initializer for a [=address spaces/private=] variable must
    be a [=const-expression=] or an [=override-expression=].
    Variables in address spaces other than [=address spaces/function=] or
    [=address spaces/private=] [=shader-creation error|must not=] have an
    initializer.

When an [=identifier=] [=resolves=] to a variable declaration, the identifier
is an expression denoting the reference [=memory view=] for the variable’s memory,
and its type is the variable’s [=reference type=].
See [[#var-identifier-expr]].

Variables in the [=address spaces/private=], [=address spaces/storage=],
[=address spaces/uniform=], [=address spaces/workgroup=], and [=address
spaces/handle=] address spaces must only be declared in [=module scope=], while
variables in the [=address spaces/function=] address space must only be
declared in [=function scope=].
The address space [=shader-creation error|must=] be specified for all address
spaces except handle and function.
The handle address space [=shader-creation error|must not=] be specified.
Specifying the function address space is optional.

The [=access mode=] always has a default value, and except for variables in the
[=address spaces/storage=] address space, [=shader-creation error|must not=] be
specified in the WGSL source.
See [[#access-mode-defaults]].

A variable in the [=address spaces/uniform=] address space is a <dfn
noexport>uniform buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] [=constructible=] type, and
must satisfy the [[#address-space-layout-constraints|address space layout
constraints]].

A variable in the [=address spaces/storage=] address space is a <dfn
noexport>storage buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] type and must satisfy the
[[#address-space-layout-constraints|address space layout constraints]].
The variable may be declared with a [=access/read=] or [=access/read_write=]
access mode; the default is read.

A <dfn>texture resource</dfn> is a variable whose [=effective-value-type=] is a [=texture type=].
It is declared at [=module scope=].
It holds an opaque handle which is used to access the underlying grid of [=texels=] in a [=texture=].
The handle itself is in the [=address spaces/handle=] address space and is always read-only.
In many cases the underlying texels are read-only, and we say the texture variable immutable.
For a write-only [=storage texture=], the underlying texels are write-only, and by convention
we say the texture variable is mutable.

A <dfn>sampler resource</dfn> is a variable whose [=effective-value-type=] is a [=sampler type=].
It is declared at [=module scope=], exists in the [=address spaces/handle=] address space,
and is immutable.

As described in [[#resource-interface]], uniform buffers, storage buffers,
textures, and samplers form the [=resource interface of a shader=].

The <dfn noexport>lifetime</dfn> of a variable is the period during shader
execution for which the [=memory locations=] are associated with the variable.
The lifetime of a [=module scope=] variable is the entire execution of the
shader stage.
There is an independent version of a variable in the [=address spaces/private=]
and [=address spaces/function=] address spaces for each invocation.
[=function scope|Function-scope=] variables are a [=dynamic context=].
The lifetime of a function-scope variable is determined by its scope:
* It starts when control enters the variable’s declaration.
* It ends when the name is no longer [=in scope=] of any part of the [=dynamic context=].
    That is, the lifetime includes any functions [=function call|called=] while
    the name is in scope.

Two [=resource=] variables may have [=overlap|overlapping memory=] locations,
but it is a [=dynamic error=] if either of those variables is mutable.
Other variables with overlapping lifetimes [=behavioral requirement|will=] not
have overlapping memory locations.
When a variable’s lifetime ends, its memory may be used for another variable.

Note: WGSL ensures the contents of a variable are only observable during the
variable’s lifetime.

When a variable in the [=address spaces/private=], [=address spaces/function=],
or [=address spaces/workgroup=] address spaces is created, it [=behavioral
requirement|will=] have an initial value.
If no initializer is specified the initial value is the <dfn noexport>default
initial value</dfn>.
The initial values are computed as follows:
* For variables in the function address space:
    * The [=zero value=] of the [=store type=], if the variable declaration did
        not specify an initializer.
    * Otherwise it is the result of evaluating the
        [=concretization of a value|concretized=] initializer expression at
        that point in program execution.
* For variables in the private address space:
    * The [=zero value=] of the [=store type=], if the variable declaration did
        not specify an initializer.
    * Otherwise it is the result of evaluating the [=concretization of a
        value|concretized=] initializer expression.
        The initializer must be an [=override-expression=], and so its value is
        fixed no later than [=pipeline creation|pipeline-creation time=].
* For variables in the workgroup address space:
    * When the [=store type=] is [=constructible=], the [=zero value=] for the
        store type.
    * If the [=store type=] is an [=atomic type=], the [=zero value=] is that
        of the underlying type ([=type/concrete=] [=integer scalar=]).
    * Otherwise, if the [=store type=] is not [=constructible=], the [=zero
        value=] is determined by recursively applying these rules to each
        [=component=] of the [=composite=] until a [=constructible=] type is
        encountered.
        * Note: This commonly occurs when using an [=array=] with a
            [=pipeline-overridable=] [=element count=] or a [=composite=] that
            contains an [=atomic type=].

Variables in other address spaces are [=resources=] set by bindings in the
[=draw command=] or [=dispatch command=].

Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading='Variable initial values'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var i: i32;         // Initial value is 0.  Not recommended style.
    loop {
      var twice: i32 = 2 * i;   // Re-evaluated each iteration.
      i++;
      if i == 5 { break; }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
The loop body will execute five times.
Variable `i` will take on values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and variable `twice` will take on values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading='Reading a variable multiple times'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var x: f32 = 1.0;
    let y = x * x + x + 1;
  </xmp>
</div>
Because `x` is a variable, all accesses to it turn into load and store operations.
However, it is expected that either the browser or the driver optimizes this intermediate representation
such that the redundant loads are eliminated.

# Expressions # {#expressions}

[=Expressions=] specify how values are computed.

The different kinds of value expressions provide a tradeoff between when they
are evaluated and how expressive they can be.
The sooner the evaluation, the more constrained the operations, but also the
more places the value can be used.  This tradeoff leads to different
flexibility with each kind of value declaration.
[=const-expressions=] and [=override-expressions=] are evaluated prior to
execution on the GPU, so only the result of the computation of the expression
is necessary in the final GPU code.
Additionally, because [=const-expressions=] are evaluated at [=shader module
creation|shader-creation time=] they can be used in more situations than
[=override-expressions=], for example, to size [=arrays=] in [=function scope=]
[=variable declaration|variables=].
A <dfn noexport>runtime expression</dfn> is an expression that is neither a
[=const-expression=] nor an [=override-expression=].
A runtime expression is computed on the GPU during shader execution.
While runtime expressions can be used by fewer grammar elements, they can be
computed from a larger class of expressions, for example, other runtime values.

## Early Evaluation Expressions ## {#early-eval-exprs}

WGSL defines two types of expressions that can be evaluated before runtime:
* [=const-expressions=], at [=shader module creation|shader-creation time=]
* [=override-expressions=], at [=pipeline creation|pipeline-creation time=]

### `const` Expressions ### {#const-expr}

Expressions that can be evaluated at [=shader module creation|shader-creation
time=] are called <dfn noexport>const-expressions</dfn>.
An expression is a const-expression if all its [=identifiers=] [=resolve=] to:
* [=const-declarations=], or
* [=const-functions=], or
* [=type aliases=], or
* [=structure=] names.

The type of a `const` expression [=shader-creation error|must=] [=type rules|resolve=] to a type with a
[=creation-fixed footprint=].

Note: [=type/abstract|Abstract types=] can be the inferred type of a const-expression.

A const-expression |E| [=behavioral requirement|will=] be evaluated if and only if:
* |E| is [=top-level expression=], or
* |E| is a [=subexpression=] of an expression |OuterE|, and |OuterE|
    [=behavioral requirement|will=] be evaluated, and evaluation of |OuterE|
    requires |E| to be evaluated.

Note: The evaluation rule implies that short-circuiting operators `&&` and `||` guard evaluation of their right-hand
side subexpressions.

Example:  `(42)` is analyzed as follows:
* The term `42` is the [=AbstractInt=] value 42.
* Surrounding that term with parentheses produces a new expression `(42)` that is
    of type [=AbstractInt=] with value 42.

Example:  `-5` is analyzed as follows:
* The term `5` is the [=AbstractInt=] value 5.
* Preceding that term with '`-`' produces a new expression `-5` that is
    of type [=AbstractInt=] with value -5.

Example:  `-2147483648` is analyzed as follows:
* The term `2147483648` is the [=AbstractInt=] value 2147483648.
    Note that this value does **not** fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
* Preceding that term with '`-`' produces a new expression `-2147483648` that is
    of type [=AbstractInt=] with value -2147483648.

Example:  `const minint = -2147483648;` is analyzed as follows:
* As above, `-2147483648` evaluates to a [=AbstractInt=] value -2147483648.
* A [=const-declaration=] allows the initializer to be an [=abstract numeric type=].
* The result is that `minint` is declared to be the [=AbstractInt=] value -2147483648.

Example:  `let minint = -2147483648;` is analyzed as follows:
* As above, `-2147483648` evaluates to a [=AbstractInt=] value -2147483648.
* A [=let-declaration=] requires the initializer to be a [=type/concrete=] [=constructible=] type or a pointer type.
* The let-declaration does not have an explicit type, so [=overload resolution=] is used.
    The overload candidates that apply use [=feasible automatic conversions=] from [=AbstractInt=] to either [=i32=], [=u32=], or [=f32=].
    The one of lowest rank is to [=i32=], and so
    [=AbstractInt=] -2147483648 value is converted to the [=i32=] value -2147483648.
* The result is that `minint` is declared to be the i32 value -2147483648.

Example:  `false && (10i < i32(5 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000))` is analyzed as follows:
* The entire expression is a const-expression.
* However, the short-circuiting rules of the `&&` operator apply:
    the left-hand side evaluates to `false`, and so the right-hand side is *not evaluated*.
* Evaluation of i32(5 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000) would have caused a [=shader-creation error=]
    because the [=AbstractInt=] value 5000000000 overflows the [=i32=] type.

### `override` Expressions ### {#override-expr}

Expressions that can be evaluated at [=pipeline creation=] time are called <dfn
noexport>override-expressions</dfn>.
An expression is an override-expression if all its [=identifiers=] [=resolve=] to:
* [=override-declarations=], or
* [=const-declarations=], or
* [=const-functions=], or
* [=type aliases=], or
* [=structure=] names.

Note: All [=const-expressions=] are also override-expressions.

An override-expression |E| [=behavioral requirement|will=] be evaluated if and only if:
* |E| is [=top-level expression=], or
* |E| is a [=subexpression=] of an expression |OuterE|, and |OuterE|
    [=behavioral requirement|will=] be evaluated, and evaluation of |OuterE|
    requires |E| to be evaluated.

Note: An override-expression may not be usable as the initializer for an
[=override-declaration=], because such initializers must [=type rules|resolve=]
to a [=type/concrete=] [=scalar=] type.

Example: `override x = 42;` is analyzed as follows:
* The term `42` is the [=AbstractInt=] value 42.
* An [=override-declaration=] requires a [=type/concrete=] [=scalar=] type.
* `42` is converted to [=i32=] via a [=feasible automatic conversion=].

Example: `let y = x + 1;` is analyzed as follows:
* From above, `x` has a type of [=i32=].
* The expression `x + 1` is an override-expression because it is composed of an
    [=override-declaration=] and an [=integer literal=].
* The expression has a type of [=i32=] and is evaluated at [=pipeline
    creation=] time.
    Its value depends on whether or not `x` is overridden at pipeline creation
    time.

Example: `vec3(x,x,x)` is analyzed as follows:
* From above, `x` is an [=override-declaration=] with the type [=i32=].
* `vec3(x,x,x)` is an override-expression because the only identifiers
    [=resolve=] to override-declarations.
* The type of the expression is a [=vector=] of 3 components
    of [=i32=] (`vec3<i32>`).

## Indeterminate values ## {#indeterminate-values}

In limited cases, an evaluation of a [=runtime expression=] can occur
using unsupported values for its [=subexpressions=].

In such a case, the result of that evaluation is
an <dfn>indeterminate value</dfn> of the expression's [=static type=],
meaning some arbitrary implementation-chosen value of the static type.

A distinct value may be produced for each unique [=dynamic context=] in which the expression is evaluated.
For example, if the evaluation occurs once per iteration of a loop, a distinct
value may be computed for each loop iteration.

Note: If the type is a floating point type and the implementation supports NaN values, then
the indeterminate value produced at runtime may be a NaN value.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Indeterminate value example">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn fun() {
       var extracted_values: array<i32,2>;
       const v = vec2<i32>(0,1);

       for (var i: i32 = 0; i < 2 ; i++) {
          // A runtime-expression used to index a vector, but outside the
          // indexing bounds of the vector, produces an indeterminate value
          // of the vector component type.
          let extract = v[i+5];

          // Now 'extract' is any value of type i32.

          // Save it for later.
          extracted_values[i] = extract;

          if extract == extract {
             // This is always executed
          }
          if extract < 2 {
             // This might be executed, but might not be executed.
             // Even though the original vector components are 0 and 1,
             // the extracted value might not be either of those values.
          }
       }
       if extracted_value[0] == extracted_values[1] {
          // This might be executed, but might not be executed.
       }
    }

    fn float_fun(runtime_index: u32) {
       const v = vec2<f32>(0,1); // A vector of floating point values

       // As in the previous example, 'float_extract' is an indeterminate value.
       // Since it is a floating point type, it may be a NaN.
       let float_extract: f32 = v[runtime_index+5];

       if float_extract == float_extract {
          // This *might not* be executed, because:
          //  -  'float_extract' may be NaN, and
          //  -  a NaN is never equal to any other floating point number,
          //     even another NaN.

## Type Constructor Expressions ## {#type-constructor-expr}

A type constructor expression explicitly creates a value of a given [=type/concrete=] [=constructible=] type.
It is a [=syntax/call_expression=] where the [=syntax/callable=] item names a [=type=].

There are three kinds of constructor expressions:
* [[#construction-from-components]]
* [[#zero-value-expr]]
* [[#conversion-expr]]

In the following sections, when a type name precedes a parenthesized argument list, any user-defined or [=predeclared=]
[=type aliases|alias=] for that type can be used instead, with the same effect.

A type constructor can appear anywhere a [=syntax/call_phrase=] can appear.
In terms of evaluation order, [[#behaviors|behavior analysis]], and [[#uniformity|uniformity analysis]],
a type constructor expression is treated like a [=function call=].

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Type constructor expressions using type aliases">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    alias my_vec3f = vec3<f32>;
    alias my_vec4f = vec4<f32>;

    // Computes vec3<f32>(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)
    const threeD_e2 = my_vec3f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

    // Same as writing vec4<f32>(threeD_e2, 0.0)
    // Computes vec4<f32>(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)
    const fourD_e2 = my_vec4f(threeD_e2, 0.0);

    // Same as writing vec3<f32>()
    // Computes vec3<f32>(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)
    const threeD_zero = my_vec3f();

    // Use the fully-elaborated name for a 4-element vector of f32.
    const fourD_ones_first  = vec4<f32>(1.0f);
    // Use vec4f, the predeclared alias to vec4<f32>.
    const fourD_ones_second = vec4f(1.0f);
  </xmp>
</div>

### Construction From Components ### {#construction-from-components}

The expressions defined in this section create a [=constructible=] value by:
* Copying an existing value of the same type (i.e. the identity function), or
* Creating a composite value from an explicit list of components.

The scalar forms given here are redundant, but provide symmetry with scalar [=conversion expressions=],
and can be used to enhance readability.

The vector and matrix forms construct vector and matrix values from various combinations of components and subvectors
with matching component types.
There are [=overloads=] for constructing vectors and matrices that specify the dimensions of the target type without having to
specify the component type; the component type is inferred from the constructor arguments.

### Zero Value Expressions ### {#zero-value-expr}

Each [=type/concrete=], [=constructible=] *T* has a unique <dfn noexport>zero value</dfn>
written in WGSL as the type followed by an empty pair of parentheses: *T* `()`.

The zero values are as follows:

* `bool()` is `false`
* `i32()` is 0
* `u32()` is 0
* `f32()` is 0.0
* `f16()` is 0.0
* The zero value for an *N*-component vector of type *T* is the *N*-component vector of the zero value for *T*.
* The zero value for an *C*-column *R*-row matrix of type *T* is the matrix of those dimensions filled with the zero value for *T*.
* The zero value for a [=constructible=] *N*-element array with element type *E* is an array of *N* elements of the zero value for *E*.
* The zero value for a [=constructible=] structure type *S* is the structure value *S* with zero-valued members.

Note: WGSL does not have zero expression for [=atomic types=],
[=runtime-sized=] arrays, or other types that are not [=constructible=].

### Conversion Expressions ### {#conversion-expr}

WGSL does not implicitly convert or promote a numeric or boolean value to another type.
Instead use a <dfn>conversion expression</dfn> as defined in the tables below.

For details on conversion to and from floating point types, see [[#floating-point-conversion]].

## Composite Value Decomposition Expressions ## {#composite-value-decomposition-expr}

### Vector Access Expression ### {#vector-access-expr}

Accessing components of a vector can be done either:
* Using array subscripting (e.g. `v[2]`), or
* Using a <dfn noexport>swizzle</dfn> name, a [=context-dependent name=] written as a sequence of convenience names, each mapping to a component of the source vector.
    * The color set of convenience names: `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` for vector components 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
    * The dimensional set of convenience names: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` for vector components 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The convenience names are accessed using the `.` notation. (e.g. `color.bgra`).

The convenience letterings [=shader-creation error|must not=] be mixed. For example, you can not use `.rybw`.

A convenience letter [=shader-creation error|must not=] access a component past the end of the vector.

The convenience letterings can be applied in any order, including duplicating letters as needed.
The provided number of letters [=shader-creation error|must=] be between 1 and 4.
That is, using convenience letters can only produce a valid vector type.

The result type depends on the number of letters provided. Assuming a `vec4<f32>`

## Expression Grammar Summary ## {#expression-grammar}

When an identifier is used as a [=syntax/callable=] item, it is one of:
* The name of a [=user-defined function=] or [=built-in function=],
    as part of a [=function call=].
* The name of a [[#struct-types|structure type]] or a [[#type-aliases|type alias]],
    as part of a [[#type-constructor-expr|constructor expression]].

[[#declaration-and-scope|Declaration and scope]] rules ensure those names are always distinct.

## Operator Precedence and Associativity ## {#operator-precedence-associativity}

This entire subsection is non-normative.

Operator precedence and associativity in [=syntax/expression|right-hand side WGSL expressions=]
emerge from their grammar in summary. Right-hand expressions group operators to organize them,
as illustrated by the following diagram:

<div class=operators1>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Operator precedence and associativity graph</figcaption>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/operators_1.mmd.svg"></object>
  </figure>
</div>

To promote readability through verbosity, the following groups do not associate with other groups:

* [=syntax/short_circuit_or_expression|Short-circuit OR=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/short_circuit_or_expression|self=] and [=syntax/relational_expression|relational=] weakly),
* [=syntax/short_circuit_and_expression|Short-circuit AND=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/short_circuit_and_expression|self=] and [=syntax/relational_expression|relational=] weakly),
* [=syntax/binary_or_expression|Binary OR=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/binary_or_expression|self=] and [=syntax/unary_expression|unary=] weakly),
* [=syntax/binary_and_expression|Binary AND=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/binary_and_expression|self=] and [=syntax/unary_expression|unary=] weakly),
* [=syntax/binary_xor_expression|Binary XOR=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/binary_xor_expression|self=] and [=syntax/unary_expression|unary=] weakly).

And the following groups do not associate with themselves:

* [=syntax/shift_expression|Shift=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/unary_expression|unary=] weakly),
* [=syntax/relational_expression|Relational=]
    (can associate with [=syntax/additive_expression|additive=] and [=syntax/shift_expression|shift=] weakly).

Associating both group sections above requires parentheses to set the relationship explicitly.
The following exemplifies where these rules render expressions invalid in comments:

<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading='Operator precedence corner cases'>
  <xmp>
    let a = x & (y ^ (z | w)); // Invalid: x & y ^ z | w
    let b = (x + y) << (z >= w); // Invalid: x + y << z >= w
    let c = x < (y > z); // Invalid: x < y > z
    let d = x && (y || z); // Invalid: x && y || z
  </xmp>
</div>

Emergent precedence controls the implicit parentheses of an expression, where the stronger
binding operator will act as if it is surrounded by parentheses when together with operators
of weaker precedence. For example, stronger binding multiplicative operators than additive will
infer `(a + (b * c))` from `a + b * c` expression. Similarly, the emergent associativity controls
the direction of these implicit parentheses. For example, a left-to-right association will
infer `((a + b) + c)` from `a + b + c` expression, whereas a right-to-left association
will infer `(* (* a))` from `* * a` expression.

The following table summarizes operator precedence, associativity, and binding, sorting
by starting with strongest to weakest. The binding column contains the stronger expression
of the given operator, meaning, for example, if "All above" is the value, then this operator
can include any of the stronger expressions. But, for example, if "Unary" is the value,
then anything weaker than unary but stronger than the operator at row would require parentheses
to bind with this operator. This column is necessary for linearly listing operators.

# Statements # {#statements}

Statements are program fragments that control its execution.
Statements are generally executed in sequential order; however,
[[#control-flow|control flow statements]] may cause a program to execute in
non-sequential order.

## Compound Statement ## {#compound-statement-section}

A <dfn>compound statement</dfn> is a brace-enclosed sequence of zero or more statements.
When a [=declaration=] is one of those statements, its [=identifier=] is [=in scope=]
from the start of the next statement until the end of the compound statement.

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>compound_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_left>`'{'`</a> [=syntax/statement=] * <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_right>`'}'`</a>
</div>

The [=syntax/continuing_compound_statement=] is a special form of compound
statement that forms the body of a [[#continuing-statement|continuing]]
statement, and allows an option [[#break-if-statement|break-if]] statement at
the end.

## Assignment Statement ## {#assignment}

An <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">assignment</dfn> evaluates an expression,
and optionally stores it in memory (thus updating the contents of a variable).


<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>assignment_statement</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/lhs_expression=] ( <a for=syntax_sym lt=equal>`'='`</a> | [=syntax/compound_assignment_operator=] ) [=syntax/expression=]

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=underscore>`'_'`</a> <a for=syntax_sym lt=equal>`'='`</a> [=syntax/expression=]
</div>


The text to the left of the operator token is the <dfn noexport>left-hand side</dfn>,
and the
expression to the right of the operator token is the <dfn noexport>right-hand side</dfn>.

### Simple Assignment ### {#simple-assignment-section}

An [=statement/assignment=] is a <dfn noexport>simple assignment</dfn> when the
[=left-hand side=] is an expression, and the operator is the <a for=syntax_sym lt=equal>`'='`</a> token.
In this case the value of the [=right-hand side=] is written to the memory referenced by the left-hand side.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th style="width:40%">Precondition<th>Statement<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="updating assignment">
    <td>|e|: |T|,<br>
        |T| is a [=type/concrete=] [=constructible=] type,<br>
        |r|: ref<|AS|,|T|,|AM|>,<br>
        |AS| is a writable [=address space=],<br>
        [=access mode=] |AM| is [=access/write=] or [=access/read_write=]<br>
    <td class="nowrap">|r| = |e|
    <td>Evaluates |e|, evaluates |r|, then writes the value computed for |e| into
        the [=memory locations=] referenced by |r|.
        Note: If the reference is an [=invalid memory reference=], the write
        may not execute, or may write to a different memory location than
        expected.
</table>

In the simplest case, the left hand side is the name of a variable.
See [[#forming-references-and-pointers]] for other cases.

    <div class='example wgsl' heading='Assignments'>
      <xmp highlight='rust'>
        struct S {
            age: i32,
            weight: f32
        }
        var<private> person: S;

        fn f() {
            var a: i32 = 20;
            a = 30;           // Replace the contents of 'a' with 30.

            person.age = 31;  // Write 31 into the age field of the person variable.

            var uv: vec2<f32>;
            uv.y = 1.25;      // Place 1.25 into the second component of uv.

            let uv_x_ptr: ptr<function,f32> = &uv.x;
            *uv_x_ptr = 2.5;   // Place 2.5 into the first component of uv.

            var friend: S;
            // Copy the contents of the 'person' variable into the 'friend' variable.
            friend = person;
        }
      </xmp>
    </div>

### Phony Assignment ### {#phony-assignment-section}

An [=statement/assignment=] is a <dfn noexport>phony assignment</dfn> when the
[=left-hand side=] is an underscore token.
In this case the [=right-hand side=] is evaluated, and then ignored.

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Precondition<th>Statement<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr algorithm="phony-assignment">
    <td>|e|: |T|,<br>
        |T| is [=constructible=], a [=pointer type=], a [=texture=] type, or a [=sampler=] type
    <td class="nowrap">_ = |e|
    <td>Evaluates |e|.

        Note: The resulting value is not stored.
        The `_` token is not an identifier, and therefore cannot be used in an expression.
</table>

A phony-assignment is useful for:
* Calling a function that returns a value, but clearly expressing that the resulting value
    is not needed.
* [=statically accessed|Statically accessing=] a variable, thus establishing it as a part of
    the [=resource interface of a shader|shader's resource interface=].

    Note: A buffer variable's store type may not be constructible, e.g. it contains an atomic type, or a runtime-sized array.
    In these cases, use a pointer to the variable's contents instead.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Using phony-assignment to throw away an un-needed function result'>
  <xmp highlight=rust>
    var<private> counter: i32;

    fn increment_and_yield_previous() -> i32 {
      let previous = counter;
      counter = counter + 1;
      return previous;
    }

    fn user() {
      // Increment the counter, but don't use the result.
      _ = increment_and_yield_previous();
    }
  </xmp>
</div>


<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Using phony-assignment to occupy bindings without using them'>
  <xmp highlight=rust>
    struct BufferContents {
        counter: atomic<u32>,
        data: array<vec4<f32>>
    }
    @group(0) @binding(0) var<storage> buf: BufferContents;
    @group(0) @binding(1) var t: texture_2d<f32>;
    @group(0) @binding(2) var s: sampler;

    @fragment
    fn shade_it() -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
      // Declare that buf, t, and s are part of the shader interface, without
      // using them for anything.
      _ = &buf;
      _ = t;
      _ = s;
      return vec4<f32>();
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Compound Assignment ### {#compound-assignment-sec}

An [=statement/assignment=] is a <dfn noexport>compound assignment</dfn> when the
[=left-hand side=] is an expression, and the operator is one of the [=syntax/compound_assignment_operators=].

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>compound_assignment_operator</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=plus_equal>`'+='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=minus_equal>`'-='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=times_equal>`'*='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=division_equal>`'/='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=modulo_equal>`'%='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=and_equal>`'&='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=or_equal>`'|='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=xor_equal>`'^='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=shift_right_equal>`'>>='`</a>

    | <a for=syntax_sym lt=shift_left_equal>`'<<='`</a>
</div>

The type requirements, semantics, and behavior of each statement is defined as if
the compound assignment expands as in the following table, except that:
* the reference expression |e1| is evaluated only once, and
* the [=reference type=] for |e1| [=shader-creation error|must=] have a [=access/read_write=] [=access mode=].

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Statement<th>Expansion
  </thead>
<tr algorithm="add-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| += |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| + (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="subtract-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| -= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| - (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="multiply-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| *= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| * (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="divide-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| /= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| / (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="modulus-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| %= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| % (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="bitwise-and-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| &= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| & (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="bitwise-or-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| |= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| | (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="bitwise-xor-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| ^= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| ^ (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="bitwise-shiftright-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| >>= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| >> (|e2|)
<tr algorithm="bitwise-shiftleft-assign">
    <td class="nowrap">|e1| <<= |e2|
    <td>|e1| = |e1| << (|e2|)
</table>

Note: The syntax does not allow a [=compound assignment=] to also be a [=phony assignment=].

Note: Even though the reference |e1| is evaluated once, its underlying memory is accessed twice:
first a [=read access=] gets the old value, and then a [=write access=] stores the updated value.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Compound assignment">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var<private> next_item: i32 = 0;

    fn advance_item() -> i32 {
       next_item += 1;   // Adds 1 to next_item.
       return next_item - 1;
    }

    fn bump_item() {
      var data: array<f32,10>;
      next_item = 0;
      // Adds 5.0 to data[0], calling advance_item() only once.
      data[advance_item()] += 5.0;
      // next_item will be 1 here.
    }

    fn precedence_example() {
      var value = 1;
      // The right-hand side of a compound assignment is its own expression.
      value *= 2 + 3; // Same as value = value * (2 + 3);
      // 'value' now holds 5.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

Note: A compound assignment can rewritten as different WGSL code that uses a [=simple assignment=] instead.
The idea is to use a pointer to hold the result of evaluating the reference once.

<p class="note" algorithm="translation compound assignment not vector component">For example,
when |e1| is *not* a reference to a component inside a vector, then
|e1|` += `|e2| can be rewritten as
`{let p = &(`|e1|`); *p = *p + (`|e2|`);}`,
where the identifier `p` is chosen to be different from all other identifiers in the program.
</p>

<p class="note" algorithm="translation compound assignment vector component">When
|e1| is a reference to a component inside a vector, the above technique
needs to be modified because WGSL does not allow [[#address-of-expr|taking the address]] in that case.
For example, if |ev| is a reference to a vector, the statement |ev|`[`|c|`] += ` |e2|
can be rewritten as `{let p = &(`|ev|`); let c0 = ` |c|`; (*p)[c0] = (*p)[c0] + (`|e2|`);}`, where
identifiers `c0` and `p` are chosen to be different from all other identifiers in the program.
</p>

## Increment and Decrement Statements ## {#increment-decrement}

An <dfn noexport>increment statement</dfn> adds 1 to the contents of a variable.
A <dfn noexport>decrement statement</dfn> subtracts 1 from the contents of a variable.

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>increment_statement</dfn> :

  <dfn for=syntax>decrement_statement</dfn> :

## Control Flow ## {#control-flow}

Control flow statements may cause the program to execute in non-sequential order.

### If Statement ### {#if-statement}

An <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">if</dfn> statement conditionally executes at most one [=compound statement=] based on
the evaluation of condition expressions.

An `if` statement has an `if` clause, followed by zero or more `else if` clauses, followed by an optional `else` clause.

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>if_statement</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/if_clause=] [=syntax/else_if_clause=] * [=syntax/else_clause=] ?
</div>

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>if_clause</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=if>`'if'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>else_if_clause</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=else>`'else'`</a> <a for=syntax_kw lt=if>`'if'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>else_clause</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=else>`'else'`</a> [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>

[=Type rule precondition=]:
The expression in each `if` and `else if` clause [=shader-creation error|must=] be of [=bool=] type.

An `if` statement is executed as follows:
* The condition associated with the `if` clause is evaluated.
    If the result is `true`,
    control transfers to the first compound statement (immediately after the condition expression).
* Otherwise, the condition of the next `else if` clause in textual order (if one exists) is evaluated
     and, if the result is `true`, control transfers to the associated compound statement.
     * This behavior is repeated for all `else if` clauses until one of the conditions evaluates to `true`.
* If no condition evaluates to `true`, then control transfers to the compound statement
    associated with the `else` clause (if it exists).

### Switch Statement ### {#switch-statement}

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">switch</dfn> statement transfers control to one of a set of [=case clauses=], or to the [=default clause=],
depending on the evaluation of a selector expression.

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>switch_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=switch>`'switch'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_left>`'{'`</a> [=syntax/switch_body=] + <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_right>`'}'`</a>
</div>
<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>switch_body</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/case_clause=]

    | [=syntax/default_alone_clause=]
</div>
<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>case_clause</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=case>`'case'`</a> [=syntax/case_selectors=] <a for=syntax_sym lt=colon>`':'`</a> ? [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>
<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>default_alone_clause</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=default>`'default'`</a> <a for=syntax_sym lt=colon>`':'`</a> ? [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>
<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>case_selectors</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/case_selector=] ( <a for=syntax_sym lt=comma>`','`</a> [=syntax/case_selector=] ) * <a for=syntax_sym lt=comma>`','`</a> ?
</div>

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>case_selector</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=default>`'default'`</a>

    | [=syntax/expression=]
</div>

A <dfn noexport>case clause</dfn> is the <a for=syntax_kw lt=case>`'case'`</a> token followed by a comma-separated list of [=syntax/case_selector|case selectors=] and a
body in the form of a [=compound statement=].

A <dfn noexport>default-alone clause</dfn> is the <a for=syntax_kw lt=default>`'default'`</a> token followed by a body in the form of a [=compound statement=].

A <dfn noexport>default clause</dfn> is either:
* a [=case clause=] where <a for=syntax_kw lt=default>`'default'`</a> appears as one of its selectors, or
* a [=default-alone clause=].

Each switch statement [=shader-creation error|must=] have exactly one [=default clause=].

The <a for=syntax_kw lt=default>`'default'`</a> token [=shader-creation error|must=] not appear more than once in a single [=syntax/case_selector=] list.

[=Type rule precondition=]:
For a single switch statement, the selector expression and all case selector expressions [=shader-creation error|must=] be of the same [=type/concrete=] [=integer scalar=] type.

The expressions in the [=syntax/case_selectors=] [=shader-creation error|must=]
be [=const-expressions=].

Two different case selector expressions in the same switch statement [=shader-creation error|must not=] have the same value.

If the selector value equals the value of an expression in a [=syntax/case_selector=] list,
then control is transferred to the body of that [=case clause=].
If the selector value does not equal any of the case selector values, then control is
transferred to the body of the [=default clause=].

When control reaches the end of the body of a clause, control transfers to the first statement after the switch statement.

When one of the statements in the body of a clause is a [=declaration=],
it follows the normal [=scope=] and [=lifetime=] rules of a declaration in a [=compound statement=].
That is, the body is a sequence of statements, and if one of those is a declaration
then the scope of that declaration extends from the start of the next statement in the sequence
until the end of the body.
The declaration executes when it is reached,
creating a new instance of the [=variable declaration|variable=] or [=value declaration|value=], and initializes it.

### Loop Statement ### {#loop-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>loop_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=loop>`'loop'`</a> <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_left>`'{'`</a> [=syntax/statement=] * [=syntax/continuing_statement=] ? <a for=syntax_sym lt=brace_right>`'}'`</a>
</div>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">loop</dfn> statement repeatedly executes a <dfn noexport>loop body</dfn>;
the loop body is specified as a [=compound statement=].
Each execution of the loop body is called an <dfn noexport>iteration</dfn>.

This repetition can be interrupted by a [=statement/break=], or
[=statement/return=] statement.

Optionally, the last statement in the loop body may be a
[=statement/continuing=] statement.

When one of the statements in the loop body is a [=declaration=],
it follows the normal [=scope=] and [=lifetime=] rules of a declaration in a [=compound statement=].
That is, the loop body is a sequence of statements, and if one of those is a declaration
then the scope of that declaration extends from the start of the next statement in the sequence
until the end of the loop body.
The declaration executes each time it is reached, so each new iteration
creates a new instance of the [=variable declaration|variable=] or [=value declaration|value=], and re-initializes it.

Note: The loop statement is one of the biggest differences from other shader
languages.

This design directly expresses loop idioms commonly found in compiled code.
In particular, placing the loop update statements at the end of the loop body
allows them to naturally use values defined in the loop body.

  <dfn for=syntax>for_update</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/variable_updating_statement=]

    | [=syntax/func_call_statement=]
</div>

The <dfn dfn-for="statement">for</dfn> statement takes the form
`for (initializer; condition; update_part) { body }` and is syntactic sugar on top of a [=statement/loop=] statement with the same `body`.
Additionally:
* If `initializer` is non-empty, it is executed inside an additional [=scope=] before the first [=iteration=].
    The scope of a declaration in the initializer extends to the end of the loop body.
* [=Type rule precondition=]: If the condition is non-empty, it [=shader-creation error|must=] be an expression of [=bool=] type.
    * If present, the condition is evaluated immediately before executing the loop body.
        If the condition is false, then a [[#break-statement]] is executed, finishing execution of the loop.
        This check is performed at the start of each loop iteration.
* If `update_part` is non-empty, it becomes a [=statement/continuing=] statement at the end of the loop body.

The `initializer` of a for loop is executed once prior to executing the loop.
When a [=declaration=] appears in the initializer, its [=identifier=] is [=in scope=] until the end of the `body`.
Unlike declarations in the `body`, the declaration is not re-initialized each iteration.

The `condition`, `body` and `update_part` execute in that order to form a loop [=iteration=].
The `body` is a special form of [=compound statement=].
The identifier of a declaration in the `body` is [=in scope=] from the start of
the next statement until the end of the `body`.
The declaration is executed each time it is reached, so each new iteration
creates a new instance of the variable or constant, and re-initializes it.

<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading="For to Loop transformation: before">

### While Statement ### {#while-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>while_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=while>`'while'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] [=syntax/compound_statement=]
</div>

The <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">while</dfn> statement is a kind of loop parameterized by a condition.
At the start of each loop [=iteration=], a boolean condition is evaluated.
If the condition is false, the while loop ends execution.
Otherwise, the rest of the iteration is executed.

[=Type rule precondition=]: The condition [=shader-creation error|must=] be of [=bool=] type.

A while loop can be viewed as syntactic sugar over either a [=statement/loop=] or [=statement/for=] statement.
The following statement forms are equivalent:
* `while`  *condition*  `{` *body_statements* `}`
* `loop { if !` *condition* `{break;}` *body_statements* `}`
* `for (;`  *condition* `;) {` *body_statements*  `}`

### Break Statement ### {#break-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>break_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=break>`'break'`</a>
</div>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">break</dfn> statement transfers control to immediately
after the body of the nearest-enclosing loop
or [=statement/switch=] statement, thus ending execution of the loop or switch statement.

A `break` statement [=shader-creation error|must=] only be used within [=statement/loop=], [=statement/for=], [=statement/while=], and [=statement/switch=] statements.

A `break` statement [=shader-creation error|must not=] be placed such that it would exit from a loop's [[#continuing-statement|continuing]] statement.
Use a [[#break-if-statement|break-if]] statement instead.

<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading="WGSL Invalid loop break from a continuing clause">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var a: i32 = 2;
    var i: i32 = 0;

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
        if i >= 4 { break; } // Invalid.  Use break-if instead.
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Break-If Statement ### {#break-if-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>break_if_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=break>`'break'`</a> <a for=syntax_kw lt=if>`'if'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] <a for=syntax_sym lt=semicolon>`';'`</a>
</div>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">break-if</dfn> statement evaluates a boolean condition;
If the condition is true, control is transferred to immediately after the body of the nearest-enclosing [=statement/loop=]
statement, ending execution of that loop.

[=Type rule precondition=]: The condition [=shader-creation error|must=] be of [=bool=] type.

Note: A break-if statement may only appear as the last statement in the body of a [[#continuing-statement|continuing]]
statement.

<div class='example wgsl function-scope' heading="WGSL Valid loop break-if from a continuing clause">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var a: i32 = 2;
    var i: i32 = 0;

      if i % 2 == 0 { continue; }

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
        break if i >= 4;
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Continue Statement ### {#continue-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>continue_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=continue>`'continue'`</a>
</div>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">continue</dfn> statement transfers control in the nearest-enclosing [=statement/loop=]:

*  forward to the [=statement/continuing=] statement at the end of the body of that loop, if it exists.
*  otherwise backward to the first statement in the loop body, starting the next [=iteration=].

A `continue` statement [=shader-creation error|must=] only be used in a [=statement/loop=], [=statement/for=] or [=statement/while=] statement.
A `continue` statement [=shader-creation error|must not=] be placed such that it would transfer
control to an enclosing [=statement/continuing=] statement.
(It is a *forward* branch when branching to a `continuing` statement.)

A `continue` statement [=shader-creation error|must not=] be placed such that it would transfer
control past a declaration used in the targeted [=statement/continuing=] statement.

Note: A `continue` can only be used in a `continuing` statement if it is used for transferring control
flow within another loop nested in the `continuing` statement. That is, a `continue`
cannot be used to transfer control to the start of the currently executing `continuing` statement.

<div class='example wgsl function-scope expect-error' heading="Invalid continue bypasses declaration">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var i: i32 = 0;
    loop {
      if i >= 4 { break; }
      if i % 2 == 0 { continue; } // <3>

      let step: i32 = 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
* <3> The `continue` is invalid because it bypasses the declaration of `step` used in the `continuing` construct

### Continuing Statement ### {#continuing-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>continuing_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=continuing>`'continuing'`</a> [=syntax/continuing_compound_statement=]

</div>

A <dfn dfn-for="statement">continuing</dfn> statement specifies a [=compound statement=] to be executed at the end of a loop [=iteration=].
The construct is optional.

The compound statement [=shader-creation error|must not=] contain a [=statement/return=] at any compound statement nesting level.

### Return Statement ### {#return-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>return_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=return>`'return'`</a> [=syntax/expression=] ?
</div>

A <dfn noexport dfn-for="statement">return</dfn> statement ends execution of the current function.
If the function is an [=entry point=], then the current shader invocation
is terminated.
Otherwise, evaluation continues with the next expression or statement after
the evaluation of the [=call site=] of the current function invocation.

If the function does not have a [=return type=], then the [=statement/return=] statement is
optional. If the return statement is provided for such a function, it [=shader-creation error|must not=]
supply a value.
Otherwise the expression [=shader-creation error|must=] be present, and is called the <dfn>return value</dfn>.
In this case the call site of this function invocation evaluates to the return value.
The type of the return value [=shader-creation error|must=] match the return type of the function.

### Discard Statement ### {#discard-statement}

A <dfn dfn-for="statement">discard</dfn> statement converts the invocation into
a [=helper invocation=] and throws away the fragment.
The `discard` statement [=shader-creation error|must=] only be used in a [=fragment=] shader stage.

More precisely, executing a `discard` statement [=behavioral requirement|will=]:

* convert the current invocation into a [=helper invocation=], and
* prevent the current fragment from being processed downstream in the [=GPURenderPipeline=].

Only statements executed prior to the `discard` statement [=behavioral
requirement|will=] have observable effects.

Note: A `discard` statement may be executed by any
[=functions in a shader stage|function in a fragment stage=] and the effect is the same:
the fragment will be thrown away.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Using the discard statement to throw away a fragment'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
  @group(0) @binding(0)
  var<storage, read_write> will_emit_color : u32;

    if pos.z < 0.001 {
      // If this is executed, then the will_emit_color variable will
      // never be set to 1 because helper invocations will not write
      // to shared memory.
      discard;
    }
    will_emit_color = 1;
  }

  @fragment
  fn main(@builtin(position) coord_in: vec4<f32>)
    -> @location(0) vec4<f32>
  {
    discard_if_shallow(coord_in);

    // Set the value to 1 and emit red, but only if the helper function
    // did not execute the discard statement.
    will_emit_color = 1;
    return vec4<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  }

## Function Call Statement ## {#function-call-statement}

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>func_call_statement</dfn> :

    | [=syntax/call_phrase=]
</div>

A function call statement executes a [=function call=].

Note: If the function [=return value|returns a value=], that value is ignored.

## Const Assertion Statement ## {#const-assert-statement}

A const assertion statement produces a [=shader-creation error=] if the
expression evaluates to `false`.
The expression [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=const-expression=].
The statement can satisfy [=statically accessed|static access=] conditions in
a shader, but otherwise has no effect on the compiled shader.
This statement can be used at [=module scope=] and within [=function scope|functions=].

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>const_assert_statement</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=const_assert>`'const_assert'`</a> [=syntax/expression=]

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading="Static assertion examples">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    const x = 1;
    const y = 2;
    const_assert x < y; // valid at module-scope.
    const_assert(y != 0); // parentheses are optional.

    fn foo() {
      const z = x + y - 2;
      const_assert z > 0; // valid in functions.
      let a  = 3;
      const_assert a != 0; // invalid, the expresion must be a const-expression.

## Statements Grammar Summary ## {#statements-summary}

The [=syntax/statement=] rule matches statements that can be used in most places inside a function body.

Additionally, certain statements may only be used in very specific contexts:

* [=syntax/continuing_compound_statement=]

## Statements Behavior Analysis ## {#behaviors}

### Rules ### {#behaviors-rules}

Some statements affecting control-flow are only valid in some contexts.
For example, [=statement/continue=] is invalid outside of a [=statement/loop=],
[=statement/for=], or [=statement/while=].
Additionally, the uniformity analysis (see [[#uniformity]]) needs to know when control flow can exit a statement in multiple different ways.

Both goals are achieved by a system for summarizing execution behaviors of statements and expressions. Behavior analysis maps each statement and expression to the set of possible ways execution proceeds after evaluation of the statement or expression completes.
As with type analysis for values and expressions, behavior analysis proceeds bottom up: first determine behaviors for certain basic statements, and then determine behavior for higher level constructs by applying combining rules.

A <dfn export>behavior</dfn> is a set, whose elements may be:
- Return
- Break
- Continue
- Next

Each of those correspond to a way to exit a compound statement: either through a keyword, or by falling to the next statement ("Next").

We note "*s*: *B*" to say that *s* respects the rules regarding behaviors, and has [=behavior=] *B*.

For each function:
- Its body [=shader-creation error|must=] be a valid statement by these rules.
- If the function has a return type, the [=behavior=] of its body [=shader-creation error|must=] be {Return}.
- Otherwise, the [=behavior=] of its body [=shader-creation error|must=] be a subset of {Next, Return}.

We assign a [=behavior=] to each function: it is its body's [=behavior=] (treating the body as a regular statement), with any "Return" replaced by "Next".
As a consequence of the rules above, a function behavior is always one of {}, or {Next}.

Behavior analysis [=shader-creation error|must=] be able to determine a
non-empty [=behavior=] for each statement, and function.

</table>

Note: The empty statement case occurs when a `loop` has an empty body, or when a `for` loop lacks an initialization or update statement.

For the purpose of this analysis:
- `for` loops get desugared (see [[#for-statement]])
- `while` loops get desugared (see [[#while-statement]])
- `loop {s}` is treated as `loop {s continuing {}}`
- `if` statements without an `else` branch are treated as if they had an empty else branch (which adds Next to their [=behavior=])
- `if` statements with `else if` branches are treated as if they were nested simple `if/else` statements
- a [=syntax/switch_body=] starting with `default` behaves just like a [=syntax/switch_body=] starting with `case _:`

Each [=built-in function=] has a [=behavior=] of {Next}.
And each operator application not listed in the table above has the same [=behavior=] as if it were a function call with the same operands and with a function's [=behavior=] of {Next}.

The behavior of a function [=shader-creation error|must=] satisfy the rules given above.

Note: It is unnecessary to analyze the behavior of expressions because they
will always be {Next} or a previously analyzed function will have produced
a error.

### Notes ### {#behaviors-notes}

This section is informative, non-normative.

Here is the full list of ways that these rules can cause a program to be rejected (this is just restating information already listed above):
- The body of a function (treated as a regular statement) has a behavior not included in {Next, Return}.
- The body of a function with a return type has a behavior which is not {Return}.
- The behavior of a continuing block contains any of Continue, or Return.
- Some obviously infinite loops have an empty behavior set, and are therefore invalid.

This analysis can be run in linear time, by analyzing the call-graph bottom-up (since the behavior of a function call can depend on the function's code).

### Examples ### {#behaviors-examples}

Here are some examples showing this analysis in action:
<div class='example wgsl expect-error' heading='Trivially dead code is allowed'>

The same example would also be invalid for the same reason if `continue` was replaced by `break`.

# Functions # {#functions}

A <dfn dfn-for="function" noexport>function</dfn> performs computational work when invoked.

A function is invoked in one of the following ways:
* By evaluating a function call expression. See [[#function-call-expr]].
* By executing a function call statement. See [[#function-call-statement]].
* An [=entry point=] function is invoked by the WebGPU implementation to perform
    the work of a [=shader stage=] in a [=pipeline=]. See [[#entry-points]]

There are two kinds of functions:
* A [=built-in function=] is provided by the WGSL implementation,
    and is always available to a WGSL program.
    See [[#builtin-functions]].
* A <dfn noexport>user-defined function</dfn> is declared in a WGSL program.

## Declaring a User-defined Function ## {#function-declaration-sec}

A <dfn noexport>function declaration</dfn> creates a user-defined function, by specifying:
* An optional set of [=attributes=].
* The name of the function.
* The formal parameter list: an ordered sequence of zero
    or more [=formal parameter=] declarations,
    which may have attributes applied,
    separated by commas, and
    surrounded by parentheses.
* An optional <dfn noexport>return type</dfn>, which may have attributes applied.
* The <dfn noexport>function body</dfn>.
    This is the set of statements to be executed when the function is [=function call|called=].

A function declaration [=shader-creation error|must=] only occur at [=module scope=].
A function name is [=in scope=] for the entire program.

A <dfn noexport>formal parameter</dfn> [=declaration=] specifies an [=identifier=] name and a type for a value that [=shader-creation error|must=] be
provided when invoking the function.
A formal parameter may have attributes.
See [[#function-calls]].
The [=scope=] of the identifier is the [=function body=].
Two formal parameters for a given function [=shader-creation error|must not=] have the same name.

Note: Some built-in functions may allow parameters to be [=abstract numeric types=];
however, this functionality is not currently supported for user-declared
functions.

The [=return type=], if specified, [=shader-creation error|must=] be [=constructible=].

WGSL defines the following attributes that can be applied to function declarations:
 * the [=shader stage attributes=]: [=attribute/vertex=], [=attribute/fragment=], and [=attribute/compute=]
 * [=attribute/workgroup_size=]

WGSL defines the following attributes that can be applied to function
parameters and return types:
 * [=attribute/builtin=]
 * [=attribute/location=]
 * [=attribute/interpolate=]
 * [=attribute/invariant=]

## Function Calls ## {#function-calls}

A <dfn noexport>function call</dfn> is a statement or expression which invokes a function.

The function containing the function call is the <dfn>calling function</dfn>, or <dfn noexport>caller</dfn>.
The function being invoked is the <dfn>called function</dfn>, or <dfn noexport>callee</dfn>.

The function call:
* Names the [=called function=], and
* Provides a parenthesized, comma-separated list of argument value expressions.

The function call [=shader-creation error|must=] supply the same number of argument values as there are
[=formal parameter|formal parameters=] in the [=called function=].
Each argument value [=shader-creation error|must=] evaluate to the same type as the corresponding formal
parameter, by position.

In summary, when calling a function:
1. Execution of the [=calling function=] is suspended.
2. The [=called function=] executes until it [=returns=].
3. Execution of the [=calling function=] resumes.

A called function <dfn>returns</dfn> as follows:
* A [=built-in function=] returns when its work has completed.
* A [=user-defined function=] with a [=return type=] returns when it executes a [=statement/return=] statement.
* A [=user-defined function=] with no [=return type=] returns when it executes a [=statement/return=] statement,
    or when execution reaches the end of its [=function body=].

In detail, when a function call is executed the following steps occur:
1. Function call argument values are evaluated.
    The relative order of evaluation is left-to-right.
2. Execution of the [=calling function=] is suspended.
    All [=function scope=] variables and constants maintain their current values.
3. If the called function is [=user-defined function|user-defined=],
    memory is allocated for each function scope variable in the called function.
    * Initialization occurs as described in [[#var-decls]].
4. Values for the formal parameters of the called function are determined
    by matching the function call argument values by position.
    For example, the first formal parameter of the called function will have
    the value of the first argument at the [=call site=].
5. Control is transferred to the called function.
    If the called function is [=user-defined function|user-defined=], execution
    proceeds starting from the first statement in the [=function body|body=].
6. The called function is executed, until it [=returns=].
7. Control is transferred back to the calling function, and the called function's execution is
    unsuspended.
    If the called function [=return value|returns a value=], that value is supplied for the
    value of the function call expression.

The location of a function call is referred to as a <dfn noexport>call site</dfn>.
Call sites are a [=dynamic context=].
As such, the same textual location may represent multiple call sites.

Note: It is possible that a function call in a [=fragment=] shader never
returns if all of the invocations in a [=quad=] are [=statement/discard|discarded=].
In such a case, control will not be tranferred back to the calling function.

## `const` Functions ## {#const-funcs}

A function declared with a [=attribute/const=] attribute can be
evaluated at [=shader module creation|shader-creation time=].
These functions are called <dfn noexport>const-functions</dfn>.
Calls to these functions can part of [=const-expressions=].

It is a [=shader-creation error=] if the function contains any expressions that
are not [=const-expressions=], or any declarations that are not
[=const-declarations=].

Note: The [=attribute/const=] attribute cannot be applied to user-declared functions.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='const-functions'>
  <xmp>
    const first_one = firstLeadingBit(1234 + 4567); // Evaluates to 12
                                                    // first_one has the type i32, because
                                                    // firstLeadingBit cannot operate on
                                                    // AbstractInt

    @id(1) override x : i32;
    override y = firstLeadingBit(x); // const-expressions can be
                                     // used in override-expressions.
                                     // firstLeadingBit(x) is not a
                                     // const-expression in this context.

    fn foo() {
      var a : array<i32, firstLeadingBit(257)>; // const-functions can be used in
                                                // const-expressions if all their
                                                // parameters are const-expressions.
    }

## Restrictions on Functions ## {#function-restriction}

* A [=vertex=] shader [=shader-creation error|must=] return the [=built-in values/position=] [=built-in output value=].
* An entry point [=shader-creation error|must=] never be the target of a [=function call=].
* If a function has a return type, it [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=constructible=] type.
* A [=formal parameter|function parameter=] [=shader-creation error|must=] one the following types:
    * a constructible type
    * a pointer type
    * a texture type
    * a sampler type
* Each function call argument [=shader-creation error|must=] evaluate to the type of the corresponding
    function parameter.
    * In particular, an argument that is a pointer [=shader-creation error|must=] agree with the formal parameter
        on [=address space=], [=store type=], and [=access mode=].
* For [=user-defined functions=], a parameter of pointer type [=shader-creation error|must=] be in one of
    the following address spaces:
    * [=address spaces/function=]
    * [=address spaces/private=]
* For [=built-in functions=], a parameter of pointer type [=shader-creation error|must=] be in one of
    the following address spaces:
    * [=address spaces/function=]
    * [=address spaces/private=]
    * [=address spaces/workgroup=]
    * [=address spaces/storage=]
* Each argument of pointer type to a [=user-defined function=]
    [=shader-creation error|must=] have the same [=memory view=] as its [=root
    identifier=].
    * Note: This means no [[#vector-access-expr|vector]],
        [[#matrix-access-expr|matrix]], [[#array-access-expr|array]], or
        [[#struct-access-expr|struct]] access expressions can be applied to
        produce a [=memory view=] into the root identifier when traced from the
        argument back through all the [=let-declarations=].

Note: Recursion is disallowed because cycles are not permitted among any kinds
of declarations.

### Alias Analysis ### {#alias-analysis}

#### Root Identifier #### {#root-ident-sec}

[=Memory locations=] can be accessed during the execution of a function using [=memory views=].
Within a function, each [=memory view=] has a particular <dfn>root identifier</dfn>, which names
the variable or formal parameter that first provides access to that memory in that function.

Locally derived expressions of [=reference type|reference=] or
[=pointer type|pointer=] type may introduce new names for a particular root identifier,
but each expression has a statically determinable root identifier.

<p algorithm="finding a root identifier">
Given an expression |E| of [=pointer type|pointer=] or [=reference type=], the
[=root identifier=] is the [=originating variable=] or [=formal parameter=] of [=pointer type=]
found as follows:
* If |E| is an identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to a variable, then the root identifier is that variable.
* If |E| is an identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to a formal parameter of pointer type, then the root identifier is that formal parameter.
* If |E| is an identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to a [=let-declaration=] with initializer |E2|, then the root identifier is the root identifier of |E2|.
* If |E| is of the form `(`|E2|`)`, `&`|E2|, `*`|E2|, or |E2|`[`<var ignore>Ei</var>`]` then the root identifier is the root identifier of |E2|.
* If |E| is a [[#vector-access-expr|vector access expression]] of the form |E2|.|swiz|, where |swiz| is a [=swizzle=] name, then the root identifer is the root identifier of |E2|.
* If |E| is a [[#struct-access-expr|structure access expression]] of the form |E2|.<var ignore>member_name</var>, then the root identifer is the root identifier of |E2|.
    <p>

#### Aliasing #### {#aliasing}

While the [=originating variable=] of a [=root identifier=] is a dynamic concept that
depends on the [=call sites=] for the function, WGSL programs can be
statically analyzed to determine the set of all possible [=originating
variables=] for each root identifier.

Two [=root identifiers=] <dfn noexport>alias</dfn> when they have the same
[=originating variable=].
Execution of a WGSL function [=shader-creation error|must not=] potentially
access memory through aliased root identifiers, where one access is a write and
the other is a read or a write.
This is determined by analyzing the program from the leaves of the callgraph
upwards (i.e. topological order).
For each function the analysis records the following sets:
* [=module scope|Module-scope=] variables that are [=write access|written=].
    This includes any module-scope variables that are written in functions called from this function.
* [=module scope|Module-scope=] variables that are [=read access|read=].
    This includes any module-scope variables that are read in functions called from this function.

# Entry Points # {#entry-points}

An <dfn noexport>entry point</dfn> is a [=user-defined function=] that performs
the work for a particular [=shader stage=].

## Shader Stages ## {#shader-stages-sec}

WebGPU issues work to the GPU in the form of [=draw command|draw=] or [=dispatch commands=].
These commands execute a pipeline in the context of a set of shader stage
[=shader stage input|inputs=], [=shader stage output|outputs=], and attached
[=resources=].

A <dfn noexport>pipeline</dfn> describes the work to be performed on the GPU, as a sequence
of stages, some of which are programmable.
In WebGPU, a pipeline is created before scheduling a draw or dispatch command for execution.
There are two kinds of pipelines: GPUComputePipeline, and GPURenderPipeline.

A [=dispatch command=] uses a <dfn noexport>GPUComputePipeline</dfn> to run a
<dfn noexport>compute shader stage</dfn> over a logical
grid of points with a controllable amount of parallelism,
while reading and possibly updating buffer and image resources.

A [=draw command=] uses a <dfn noexport>GPURenderPipeline</dfn> to run a multi-stage process with
two programmable stages among other fixed-function stages:

* A <dfn noexport>vertex shader stage</dfn> maps input attributes for a single vertex into
    output attributes for the vertex.
* Fixed-function stages map vertices into graphic primitives (such as triangles)
    which are then rasterized to produce fragments.
* A <dfn noexport>fragment shader stage</dfn> processes each fragment,
    possibly producing a fragment output.
* Fixed-function stages consume a fragment output, possibly updating external state
    such as color attachments and depth and stencil buffers.

The WebGPU specification describes pipelines in greater detail.

WGSL defines three <dfn noexport>shader stages</dfn>, corresponding to the
programmable parts of pipelines:

* <dfn noexport>compute</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>vertex</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>fragment</dfn>

Each shader stage has its own set of features and constraints, described elsewhere.

## Entry Point Declaration ## {#entry-point-decl}

To create an [=entry point=], declare a [=user-defined function=] with a [=shader stage attribute=].

When configuring a [=pipeline=] in the WebGPU API,
the entry point's function name maps to the `entryPoint` attribute of the
WebGPU {{GPUProgrammableStage}} object.

The entry point's [=formal parameters=] denote the stage's [=shader stage inputs=].
The entry point's [=return value=], if specified, denotes the stage's [=shader stage outputs=].

The type of each formal parameter, and the entry point's return type, [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of:
* [=bool=]
* a [=numeric scalar=]
* a [=numeric vector=]
* a [=structure=] whose member types are any of [=bool=], [=numeric scalar=], or [=numeric vector=].

A structure type can be used to group [=user-defined input datum|user-defined inputs=] with each other and optionally with [=built-in input value|built-in inputs=].
A structure type can be used as the [=return type=] to group [=user-defined output datum|user-defined outputs=] with each other and optionally with [=built-in output value|built-in outputs=].

Note: The [=bool=] case is forbidden for user-defined inputs and outputs.
It is only permitted for the [=built-in values|front_facing builtin value=].

Note: [=Compute=] entry points never have a return type.

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='Entry Point'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @vertex
    fn vert_main() -> @builtin(position) vec4<f32> {
      return vec4<f32>(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }

    @fragment
    fn frag_main(@builtin(position) coord_in: vec4<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
      return vec4<f32>(coord_in.x, coord_in.y, 0.0, 1.0);
    }

    @compute @workgroup_size(1)
    fn comp_main() { }
  </xmp>
</div>

The set of <dfn noexport>functions in a shader stage</dfn> is the union of:

* The entry point function for the stage.
* The targets of function calls from within the body of a function
    in the shader stage, whether or not that call is executed.

The union is applied repeatedly until it stabilizes.
It will stabilize in a finite number of steps.

### Function Attributes for Entry Points ### {#entry-point-attributes}

WGSL defines the following attributes that can be applied to entry point declarations:
 * the [=shader stage attributes=]: [=attribute/vertex=], [=attribute/fragment=], and [=attribute/compute=]
 * [=attribute/workgroup_size=]

ISSUE: Can we query upper bounds on workgroup size dimensions?  Is it independent of the shader, or
  a property to be queried after creating the shader module?

<div class='example wgsl global-scope' heading='workgroup_size Attribute'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @compute @workgroup_size(8,4,1)
    fn sorter() { }

    @compute @workgroup_size(8u)
    fn reverser() { }

    // Using an pipeline-overridable constant.
    @id(42) override block_width = 12u;
    @compute @workgroup_size(block_width)
    fn shuffler() { }

    // Error: workgroup_size must be specified on compute shader
    @compute
    fn bad_shader() { }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Shader Interface ## {#shader-interface}

The shader interface is the set of objects
through which the shader accesses data external to the [=shader stage=],
either for reading or writing, and the [=pipeline-overridable=] constants used to configure the shader.
The interface includes:

* [=Shader stage inputs=]
* [=Shader stage outputs=]
* [=Override-declarations=]
* Attached [=resources=], which include:
    * [=Uniform buffers=]
    * [=Storage buffers=]
    * [=Texture resources=]
    * [=Sampler resources=]

A declaration *D* is <dfn>statically accessed</dfn> by a shader when:
* An identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to *D* appears in the [=function declaration|declaration=]
    of any of the [=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=].
* An identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to *D* is used to define a type for a [=statically accessed=] declaration.
* An identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to *D* is used in the initializer for a [=statically accessed=] declaration.
* An identifier [=resolves|resolving=] to *D* is used by an attribute used by a [=statically accessed=] declaration.

<div class="note">Note: Static access is recursively defined, taking into account the following:
* All the parts of a [=function declaration=] including attributes, formal parameters, return type, and function body.
* Any type needed to define the above, including following [=type aliases=].
* As a particular case of helping to define a type,
    any [=override-declaration=] used in an [=override-expression=] that is the [=element count=]
    of an [=array=] type for a variable in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] address space,
    when that variable itself is statically accessed.
* Any override declarations used to support the evaluation of override-expressions in any of the above.
* Any attributes on any of the above.
    </div>

We can now precisely define the <dfn noexport>interface of a shader</dfn> as consisting of:
  - The [=formal parameters=] of the [=entry point=].
     These denote the shader stage inputs.
  - The [=return value=] of the entry point.
     This denotes the shader stage outputs.
  - The [=uniform buffer=], [=storage buffer=], [=texture resource=], and [=sampler resource=] variables
        [=statically accessed=] by the shader.
  - The [=override-declarations=]
        [=statically accessed=] by the shader.

### Inter-stage Input and Output Interface ### {#stage-inputs-outputs}

A <dfn noexport>shader stage input</dfn> is a datum provided to the shader stage from upstream in the pipeline.
Each datum is either a [=built-in input value=], or a [=user-defined input datum|user-defined input=].

A <dfn noexport>shader stage output</dfn> is a datum the shader provides for further processing downstream in the pipeline.
Each datum is either a [=built-in output value=], or a [=user-defined output datum|user-defined output=].

[=IO attributes=] are used to establish an object as a [=shader stage input=] or a [=shader stage output=],
or to further describe the properties of an input or output.
The <dfn noexport>IO attributes</dfn> are:
* [=attribute/builtin=]
* [=attribute/location=]
* [=attribute/interpolate=]
* [=attribute/invariant=]

#### Built-in Inputs and Outputs #### {#builtin-inputs-outputs}

A <dfn noexport>built-in input value</dfn> provides access to system-generated control information.
The set of built-in inputs are listed in [[#builtin-values]].
An entry point [=shader-creation error|must=] not contain duplicated built-in inputs.

A built-in input for stage *S* with name *X* and type *T*<sub>*X*</sub> is accessed via a
[=formal parameter=] to an [=entry point=] for [=shader stage=] *S*, in one of two ways:

1. The parameter has attribute `builtin(`*X*`)` and is of type *T*<sub>*X*</sub>.
2. The parameter has structure type, where one of the structure members has attribute `builtin(`*X*`)` and is of type *T*<sub>*X*</sub>.

Conversely, when a parameter or member of a parameter for an entry point has a [=attribute/builtin=] attribute,
the corresponding builtin [=shader-creation error|must=] be an input for the entry point's shader stage.

A <dfn noexport>built-in output value</dfn> is used by the shader to convey
control information to later processing steps in the pipeline.
The set of built-in outputs are listed in [[#builtin-values]].
An entry point [=shader-creation error|must=] not contain duplicated built-in outputs.

A built-in output for stage *S* with name *Y* and type *T*<sub>*Y*</sub> is set via the [=return value=] for an
[=entry point=] for [=shader stage=] *S*, in one of two ways:

1. The entry point [=return type=] has attribute `builtin(`*Y*`)` and is of type *T*<sub>*Y*</sub>.
2. The entry point [=return type=] has structure type, where one of the structure members has attribute `builtin(`*Y*`)` and is of type *T*<sub>*Y*</sub>.

Conversely, when the return type or member of a return type for an entry point has a [=attribute/builtin=] attribute,
the corresponding builtin [=shader-creation error|must=] be an output for the entry point's shader stage.

Note: The [=built-in values/position=] built-in is both an output of a vertex shader, and an input to the fragment shader.

Collectively, built-in input and built-in output values are known as <dfn noexport>built-in values</dfn>.

#### User-defined Inputs and Outputs #### {#user-defined-inputs-outputs}

User-defined data can be passed as input to the start of a pipeline, passed
between stages of a pipeline or output from the end of a pipeline.

Each <dfn noexport>user-defined input datum</dfn> and
<dfn noexport>user-defined output datum</abbrev></dfn> [=shader-creation error|must=]:
* be of [=numeric scalar=] type or [=numeric vector=] type.
* be assigned an IO location. See [[#input-output-locations]].


A [=compute=] shader [=shader-creation error|must not=] have user-defined inputs or outputs.

#### Input-output Locations #### {#input-output-locations}

Each input-output location can store a value up to 16 bytes in size.
The byte size of a type is defined using the *SizeOf* column in [[#alignment-and-size]].
For example, a four-component vector of floating-point values occupies a single location.

IO locations are specified via the [=attribute/location=] attribute.

Each user-defined [=user-defined input datum|input=] and [=user-defined output datum|output=] [=shader-creation error|must=] have an explicitly specified IO location.
Each structure member in the entry point IO [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of either a built-in value
(see [[#builtin-inputs-outputs]]), or assigned a location.

Locations [=shader-creation error|must not=] overlap within each of the following sets:
* Members within a structure type.
    This applies to any structure, not just those used in shader stage inputs or outputs.
* An entry point's shader stage inputs,
    i.e. locations for its formal parameters, or for the members of its formal parameters of structure type.

Note: Location numbering is distinct between inputs and outputs:
Location numbers for an entry point's shader stage inputs do not conflict with location numbers for the entry point's shader stage outputs.

Note: No additional rule is required to prevent location overlap within an entry point's outputs.
When the output is a structure, the first rule above prevents overlap.
Otherwise, the output is a scalar or a vector, and can have only a single location assigned to it.

Note: The number of available locations for an entry point is defined by the WebGPU API.

<div class='example wgsl applying location attribute' heading='Applying location attributes'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct A {
      @location(0) x: f32,
      // Despite locations being 16-bytes, x and y cannot share a location
      @location(1) y: f32
    }

    // in1 occupies locations 0 and 1.
    // in2 occupies location 2.
    // The return value occupies location 0.
    @fragment
    fn fragShader(in1: A, @location(2) in2: f32) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
     // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

User-defined IO can be mixed with built-in values in the same structure. For example,

<div class='example wgsl mixing builtins and user-defined IO' heading='Mixing builtins and user-defined IO'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // Mixed builtins and user-defined inputs.
    struct MyInputs {
      @location(0) x: vec4<f32>,
      @builtin(front_facing) y: bool,
      @location(1) @interpolate(flat) z: u32
    }

    struct MyOutputs {
      @builtin(frag_depth) x: f32,
      @location(0) y: vec4<f32>
    }

    @fragment
    fn fragShader(in1: MyInputs) -> MyOutputs {
      // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example wgsl invalid locations' heading='Invalid location assignments'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct A {
      @location(0) x: f32,
      // Invalid, x and y cannot share a location.
      @location(0) y: f32
    }

    struct B {
      @location(0) x: f32
    }

    struct C {
      // Invalid, structures with user-defined IO cannot be nested.
      b: B
    }

    struct D {
      x: vec4<f32>
    }

    @fragment
    // Invalid, location cannot be applied to a structure type.
    fn fragShader1(@location(0) in1: D) {
      // ...
    }

    @fragment
    // Invalid, in1 and in2 cannot share a location.
    fn fragShader2(@location(0) in1: f32, @location(0) in2: f32) {
      // ...
    }

    @fragment
    // Invalid, location cannot be applied to a structure.
    fn fragShader3(@location(0) in1: vec4<f32>) -> @location(0) D {
      // ...
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

#### Interpolation #### {#interpolation}

Authors can control how user-defined IO data is interpolated through the use of
the [=attribute/interpolate=] attribute.
WGSL offers two aspects of interpolation to control: the type of
interpolation, and the sampling of the interpolation.

The <dfn noexport>interpolation type</dfn> [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of:
* `perspective` - Values are interpolated in a perspective correct manner.
* `linear` - Values are interpolated in a linear, non-perspective correct manner.
* `flat` - Values are not interpolated.
    Interpolation sampling is not used with `flat` interpolation.

The <dfn noexport>interpolation sampling</dfn> [=shader-creation error|must=] be one of:
* `center` - Interpolation is performed at the center of the pixel.
* `centroid` - Interpolation is performed at a point that lies within all the
    samples covered by the fragment within the current primitive.
    This value is the same for all samples in the primitive.
* `sample` - Interpolation is performed per sample.
    The [=fragment=] shader is invoked once per sample when this attribute is
    applied.

For user-defined IO of scalar or vector floating-point type:
* If the interpolation attribute is not specified, then `@interpolate(perspective, center)` is assumed.
* If the interpolation attribute is specified with an interpolation type:
    * If the interpolation type is `flat`, then interpolation sampling [=shader-creation error|must not=] be specified.
    * If the interpolation type is `perspective` or `linear`, then:
         * Any interpolation sampling is valid.
         * If interpolation sampling is not specified, `center` is assumed.

User-defined [=vertex=] outputs and [=fragment=] inputs of scalar or vector
integer type [=shader-creation error|must=] always be specified as
`@interpolate(flat)`.

Interpolation attributes [=shader-creation error|must=] match between [=vertex=] outputs and [=fragment=]
inputs with the same [=attribute/location=] assignment within the same [=pipeline=].


### Resource Interface ### {#resource-interface}

A <dfn noexport>resource</dfn> is an object which provides access to data external to a [=shader stage=],
and which is not an [=override-declaration=] and not a [[#stage-inputs-outputs|shader stage input or output]].
Resources are shared by all invocations of the shader.

There are four kinds of resources:

* [=Uniform buffers=]
* [=Storage buffers=]
* [=Texture resources=]
* [=Sampler resources=]

The <dfn noexport>resource interface of a shader</dfn> is the set of module-scope
resource variables [=statically accessed=] by
[=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=].

Each resource variable [=shader-creation error|must=] be declared with both [=attribute/group=] and [=attribute/binding=]
attributes.
Together with the shader's stage, these identify the binding address
of the resource on the shader's pipeline.
See [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout]].

Two different resource variables in a [=shader=] [=shader-creation error|must
not=] have the same [=attribute/group=] and [=attribute/binding=] values, when
considered as a pair.

### Resource Layout Compatibility ### {#resource-layout-compatibility}

WebGPU requires that a shader's resource interface match the [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout|layout of the pipeline]]
using the shader.

It is a [=pipeline-creation error=] if a WGSL variable in a resource interface is bound to an incompatible WebGPU
[=binding resource type=] or [=binding type=],
where compatibility is defined by the following table.
<table class='data'>

# Language Extensions # {#language-extensions}

The WGSL language is expected to evolve over time.

An <dfn noexport>extension</dfn> is a named grouping for a coherent
set of modifications to a particular version of the WGSL specification, consisting of any combination of:
* Addition of new concepts and behaviors via new syntax, including:
    * declarations, statements, attributes, and built-in functions.
* Removal of restrictions in the current specification or in previously published extensions.
* Syntax for reducing the set of permissible behaviors.
* Syntax for limiting the features available to a part of the program.
* A description of how the extension interacts with the existing specification, and optionally with other extensions.

Hypothetically, extensions could be used to:
* Add numeric scalar types, such as different bit width integers.
* Add syntax to constrain floating point rounding mode.
* Add syntax to signal that a shader does not use atomic types.
* Add new kinds of statements.
* Add new built-in functions.
* Add constraints on how shader invocations execute.
* Add new shader stages.

## Enable Directive ## {#enable-directive-section}

An <dfn noexport>enable directive</dfn> indicates that the functionality
described by a particular named
[=extension=] may be used.
The grammar rules imply that all enable directives [=shader-creation error|must=] appear before any [=declarations=] or [[#const-assert-statement|const assertions]].

The directive uses a [=context-dependent name=] to name the extension.

In particular, an extension name may be spelled the same as a [=keyword=] or [=reserved word=],
but is not interpreted as any of those.

The valid extensions are listed in [[#extension-list]].

<div class='syntax' noexport='true'>
  <dfn for=syntax>enable_directive</dfn> :

    | <a for=syntax_kw lt=enable>`'enable'`</a> [=syntax/extension_name=] <a for=syntax_sym lt=semicolon>`';'`</a>
</div>

Note: The grammar rule includes the terminating semicolon token,
ensuring the additional functionality is usable only after that semicolon.
Therefore any WGSL implementation can parse the entire `enable` directive.
When an implementation encounters an enable directive for an unsupported extension,
the implementation can issue a clear diagnostic.

<div class='example wgsl using extensions expect-error' heading="Using hypothetical extensions">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    // Enable a hypothetical extension for arbitrary precision floating point types.
    enable arbitrary_precision_float;
    enable arbitrary_precision_float; // A redundant enable directive is ok.

    // Enable a hypothetical extension to control the rounding mode.
    enable rounding_mode;

    // Assuming arbitrary_precision_float enables use of:
    //    - a type f<E,M>
    //    - as a type in function return, formal parameters and let-declarations
    //    - as a type constructor from AbstractFloat
    //    - operands to division operator: /
    // Assuming @rounding_mode attribute is enabled by the rounding_mode enable directive.
    @rounding_mode(round_to_even)
    fn halve_it(x : f<8, 7>) -> f<8, 7> {
      let two = f<8, 7>(2);
      return x / 2; // uses round to even rounding mode.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

# Execution # {#execution}

[[#technical-overview]] describes how a shader is invoked and partitioned into [=invocations=].
This section describes further constraints on how invocations execute,
individually and collectively.

## Program Order Within an Invocation ## {#program-order}

Each statement in a WGSL program may be executed zero or more times during
execution.
For a given invocation, each execution of a given statement represents a unique
<dfn noexport>dynamic statement instance</dfn>.

When a statement includes an expression, the statement’s semantics determines:
* Whether the expression is evaluated as part of statement execution.
* The relative ordering of evaluation between independent expressions in the statement.

Expression nesting defines data dependencies which must be satisfied to
complete evaluation.
That is, a nested expression must be evaluated before the enclosing expression
can be evaluated.
The order of evaluation for operands of an expression is left-to-right in
WGSL.
For example, `foo() + bar()` must evaluate `foo()` before `bar()`.
See [[#expressions]].

Statements in a WGSL program are executed in control flow order.
See [[#statements]] and [[#function-calls]].

## Uniformity ## {#uniformity}

[[#collective-operations|Collective operations]] (e.g. barriers and
derivatives) require coordination among different invocations running
concurrently on the GPU.  To ensure correct and portable behavior, WGSL
requires that these operations can be statically analyzed to not have any
control dependencies such that a non-empty strict subset of invocations will
execute the operation (i.e. the operation must be executed in [=uniform control
flow=]).
Non-uniform control dependencies arise from [[#control-flow|control flow]]
statements whose behavior depends on [=uniform value|non-uniform values=].
These non-uniform values can be traced back to certain sources that are not
statically proven to be uniform.
These sources include, but are not limited to:
* Mutable [=module scope|module-scope=] [=variables=]
* Most [=built-in values=], except [=built-in values/num_workgroups=] and [=built-in values/workgroup_id=]
* [=user-defined input datum|User-defined inputs=]
* Certain [=built-in functions=] (see [[#uniformity-function-calls]])

The remainder of this section is devoted to a description of this static
analysis an implementation [=behavioral requirement|will=] perform to validate
the WGSL program.

### Terminology and Concepts ### {#uniformity-concepts}

The following definitions are merely informative, trying to give an intuition for what the analysis in the next subsection is computing.
The analysis is what actually defines these concepts, and when a program is valid or breaks the uniformity rules.

For a given group of invocations:
- If all invocations in a given scope execute as if they are executing in lockstep at a given
    point in the program, that point is said to have <dfn noexport>uniform control flow</dfn>.
    - For a [=compute shader stage=], the scope of uniform control flow is all invocations
        in the same [=compute shader stage/workgroup=].
    - For other shader stages, the scope of uniform control flow is all invocations for that
        [=entry point=] in the same [=draw command=].
- If an expression is executed in uniform control flow, and all invocations compute the
    same value, it is said to be a <dfn noexport>uniform value</dfn>.
- If invocations hold the same value for a local variable at every point where it is live,
    it is said to be a <dfn noexport>uniform variable</dfn>.

### Uniformity Analysis Overview ### {#uniformity-overview}

The remaining subsections specify a static analysis that verifies that
[[#collective-operations|collective operations]] are only executed in [=uniform
control flow=].

<div class="note">Note: This analysis has the following desirable properties:
      - Sound (meaning that it rejects every program that would break the uniformity requirements of builtins)
      - Linear time complexity (in the number of tokens in the program)
      - Refactoring a piece of code into a function, or inlining a function, cannot make a shader invalid if it was valid before the transformation
      - If the analysis refuses a program, it provides a straightforward chain of implications that can be used by the user agent to craft a good error message
</div>

Each function is analyzed, verifying that there is a context where it is safe to call this function. It rejects the program as invalid if there is no such context.

At the same time, it computes metadata about the function to help analyze its callers in turn.
This means that the call graph must first be built, and functions must be analyzed from the leaves upwards, i.e. from functions that call no function outside the standard library toward the entry point.
This way, whenever a function is analyzed, the metadata for all of its callees has already been computed.
There is no risk of being trapped in a cycle, as recurrence is forbidden in the language.

Note: Another way of saying the same thing is that we do a topological sort of functions ordered by the "is a (possibly indirect) callee of" partial order, and analyze them in that order.

### Analyzing the Uniformity Requirements of a Function ### {#uniformity-function}

Each function is analyzed in two phases.

The first phase walks over the syntax of the function, building a directed graph along the way based on the rules in the following subsections.
The second phase explores that graph, resulting in either rejecting the program, or computing the constraints on calling this function.

<div class="note">Note: Apart from two special nodes [=RequiredToBeUniform=] and [=MayBeNonUniform=], all nodes can be understood as having one of the following meanings:
        - A specific point of the program [=shader-creation error|must=] be executed in [=uniform control flow=]
        - An expression [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=uniform value=]
        - A variable [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=uniform variable=]

        An edge can be understood as an implication from the statement corresponding to its source node to the statement corresponding to its target node.

        To express that uniformity requirement (e.g. the control flow at the call site of a derivative), we add an edge from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to the corresponding node.
        One way to understand this, is that [=RequiredToBeUniform=] corresponds to the proposition True, so that [=RequiredToBeUniform=] -> X is the same as saying that X is true.

        Reciprocally, to express that we cannot ensure the uniformity of something (e.g. a variable which holds the thread id), we add an edge from the corresponding node to [=MayBeNonUniform=].
        One way to understand this, is that [=MayBeNonUniform=] corresponds to the proposition False, so that X -> [=MayBeNonUniform=] is the same as saying that X is false.

        A consequence of this interpretation is that every node reachable from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] corresponds to something which is required to be uniform for the program to be valid, and every node from which [=MayBeNonUniform=] is reachable corresponds to something whose uniformity we cannot guarantee. It follows that we have a uniformity violation (and thus reject the program) if there is any path from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to [=MayBeNonUniform=].
</div>

For each function, two tags are computed:
  * A <dfn noexport>call site tag</dfn> describing the control flow uniformity requirements on the [=call sites=] of the function, and
  * A <dfn noexport>function tag</dfn> describing the function's effects on uniformity.

Additionally, for each [=formal parameter=] of a function, a parameter tag is
computed and, if the parameter is a [=address spaces/function=] address space
pointer, a pointer parameter tag is also computed.
The <dfn noexport>parameter tag</dfn> describes the uniformity requirement of
the parameter value.
The <dfn noexport>pointer parameter tag</dfn> describes whether the value
stored in the memory pointed to by the parameter becomes [=uniform
value|non-uniform=] during the execution of the function call.

      <td>The parameter [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=uniform value=] in order for the [=return value=] to be a uniform value.

  <tr><td><dfn noexport>PointerParameterNoRestriction</dfn>
      <td>The uniformity of the value stored in the memory pointed to by the pointer parameter is unaffected by the function call.
</table>

The following algorithm describes how to compute these tags for a given function:

* Create nodes called <dfn noexport>RequiredToBeUniform</dfn>, <dfn noexport>MayBeNonUniform</dfn>, <dfn noexport>CF_start</dfn>, and if the function has a [=return type=] a node called <dfn noexport>Value_return</dfn>.
* Create one node for each parameter of the function which we'll call <dfn noexport>param_i</dfn>.
* Desugar pointers as described in [[#pointer-desugar]].
    * For each pointer parameter in the [=address spaces/function=] address space,
        create a <dfn noexport>Value_return_i</dfn> node.
* Walk over the syntax of the function, adding nodes and edges to the graph following the rules of the next sections ([[#func-var-value-analysis]], [[#uniformity-statements]], [[#uniformity-function-calls]], [[#uniformity-expressions]]), using [=CF_start=] as the starting control-flow for the function's body.
* For each [=Value_return_i=] node, record which [=param_i=] nodes are reachable from it.
* Look at which nodes are reachable from [=RequiredToBeUniform=].
    * If this set includes the node [=MayBeNonUniform=], then reject the program.
    * If this set includes [=CF_start=], then the [=call site tag=] for the function is [=CallSiteRequiredToBeUniform=].
    * Otherwise, the [=call site tag=] is [=CallSiteNoRestriction=].
    * For each [=param_i=] in this set, the corresponding [=parameter tag=] is [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniform=].
    * Remove from the graph all nodes that have been visited.
* If [=Value_return=] exists, look at which nodes are reachable from it
    * If this set includes [=MayBeNonUniform=], then the [=function tag=] is [=ReturnValueMayBeNonUniform=].
    * For each [=param_i=] in this set, the corresponding [=parameter tag=] is [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniformForReturnValue=].
* For each [=Value_return_i=] node, look at which nodes are reachable from it
    * If this set includes [=MayBeNonUniform=], the corresponding [=pointer parameter tag=] is [=PointerParameterMayBeNonUniform=].
    * Otherwise, the corresponding [=pointer parameter tag=] is [=PointerParameterNoRestriction=].
* If the [=function tag=] has not been assigned, then it is [=NoRestriction=].
* For each parameter, if it has not been assigned a [=parameter tag=], then it is [=ParameterNoRestriction=].

Note: The entire graph can be destroyed at this point. The tags listed above are all that we need to remember to analyze callers of this function.

### Pointer Desugaring ### {#pointer-desugar}

Each [=formal parameter|parameter=] of [=pointer type=] in the [=address
spaces/function=] address space is desugared as a local variable declaration
whose initial value is equivalent to dereferencing the parameter.
That is, function address space pointers are viewed as aliases to a local
variable declaration.

Each [=let-declaration=], *L*, with an [=effective-value-type=] that is a [=pointer type=] is desugared as follows:
* Visit each subexpression, *SE*, of the initializer expression of *L* in a postorder depth-first traversal:
    * If  *SE* invokes the [=load rule=] during [=type checking=] and the [=root identifier=]
        is a mutable variable then:
        * Create a new let-declaration, *LSE*, immediately prior to *L* initialized with *SE*.
        * Replace *SE* in *L* with a [[#value-identifier-expr|value identifier expression]]
            composed of *LSE*.
* Record the, possibly updated, initializer expression of *L*.
* Substitute each [=identifier=] that [=resolves=] to *L* with the recorded
    initializer expression (wrapped in a [[#parenthesized-expressions|parenthesized expression]]).

This desugaring simplifies the subsequent analyses by exposing the [=root identifier=]
of the pointer directly at each of its uses.

Note: For the purposes of uniformity analysis [=type checking=] is described to
occur both before and after this desugaring has occurred.

      let p1 = p;

      x = 0;
      *p2 = 5;
      return (*p1)[x];
    }

    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Function-scope Variable Value Analysis ### {#func-var-value-analysis}

The value of each [=function scope|function-scope=] [=variable=] at a
particular statement can be analyzed in terms of the assignments that reach it
and, potentially, its initial value.

An assignment is a <dfn noexport>full assignment</dfn> if:
* The variable's [=effective-value-type=] is a [=scalar=] type, or
* the variable's [=effective-value-type=] is a [=composite=] type and each
    [=component=] of the composite is assigned a value.

Otherwise, an assignment is a <dfn noexport>partial assignment</dfn>.

A <dfn>full reference</dfn> is an expression of [=reference type=] that is one of:
* an identifier *x* that [=resolves=] to a variable, or
* `(`*r*`)` where *r* is a [=full reference=], or
* `*`*p* where *p* is a [=full pointer=].

A <dfn>full pointer</dfn> is an expression of [=pointer type=] that is one of:
* `&`*r* where *r* is a [=full reference=], or
* an identifier *p* that [=resolves=] to a [=let-declaration=] initialized to a [=full pointer=], or
* `(`*p*`)` where *p* is a [=full pointer=].

Note: For the purposes of this analysis, we don't need the case where
a formal parameter of pointer type may be a full pointer.

A [=full reference=], and similarly a [=full pointer=], is a [=memory view=]
for *all* the memory locations for the corresponding [=originating variable=] *x*.

A reference that is not a [=full reference=] is a <dfn noexport>partial reference</dfn>.
As such, a partial reference is either:
* a memory view for a strict subset of the memory locations
    for the corresponding [=originating variable=], or
* a memory view the with same set of locations as the corresponding
    originating variable, but with a different [=store type=].

<div class="note">
Note: A [=partial reference=] can still cover all the same memory locations
as a full reference, i.e. all the locations used by a variable declaration.
This can occur when the store type is a structure type having only one member,
or when the store type is an array type with one element.

Consider a structure type with a single member, and a variable storing that type:

```rust
     struct S { member: i32; }
     fn foo () {
        var v: S;
     }
```

Then `v` is a full reference and `v.member` is a partial reference.
Their memory views cover the same memory
locations, but the store type for `v` is `S` and the store type of `v.s` is `i32`.

A similar situation occurs with arrays having a single element:

```rust
     fn foo () {
        var arr: array<i32,1>;
     }
```

Then `arr` is a full reference and `arr[0]` is a partial reference.
Their memory views cover the same memory
locations, but the store type for `arr` is `array<i32,1>` and the store type of `arr[0]` is `i32`.

To simplify analysis, an assignment via *any* kind of [=partial reference=] is treated as if
it does *not* modify every memory location in the associated [=originating variable=].
This causes the analysis to be conservative, potentially rejecting
more programs than strictly necessary.
</div>

An assignment through a [=full reference=] is a [=full assignment=].

An assignment through a [=partial reference=] is a [=partial assignment=].

When the uniformity rules in subsequent sections refer to the value for a
function-scope variable used as an RValue, it means the value of the variable
prior to evaluation of the RValue expression.
When the uniformity rules in subsequent sections refer to the value for a
function-scope variable used as an LValue, it means the value of the variable
after execution of the statement the expression appears in.

Multiple assignments to a variable might reach a use of that variable due to
[[#control-flow|control-flow statements]] or partial assignments.
The analysis joins multiple assignments reaching out of control-flow statements
by unioning the set of assignments that reach each control-flow exit.

The following table describes the rules for joining assignments.
In the uniformity graph, each join is an edge from the result node to node
representing the source of the value.
It is written in terms of an arbitrary variable `x`. It uses the following
notations:
* *Vin*(*S*) is the value of `x` prior the execution of the statement *S*.
* *Vout*(*S*) is the value of `x` after the execution of the statement *S*.
* *Vout*(*prev*) is the value of `x` prior to the execution of the current statement.
* *Vin*(*next*) is the value of `x` prior to the execution of the next statement.
* *V*(*e*) is a value node for an expression as in the subsequent sections.
* *V*(*0*) is the zero value of `x`'s [=effective-value-type=].

### Uniformity Rules for Statements ### {#uniformity-statements}

The rules for analyzing statements take as argument both the statement itself and the node corresponding to control flow at the beginning of it (which we'll note "CF" below) and return both of the following:

* A node corresponding to control flow at the exit of it
* A set of new nodes and edges to add to the graph

In the table below, `(CF1, S) => CF2` means "run the analysis on S starting with control flow CF1, apply the required changes to the graph, and name the resulting control flow CF2".
Similarly, `(CF1, E) => (CF2, V)` means "run the analysis on expression E, starting with control flow CF1, apply the required changes to the graph, and name the resulting control flow node CF2 and the resulting value node V" (see next section for the analysis of expressions).

We have a similar set of rules for expressions in left-value positions, that we denote by `LValue: (CF, E) => (CF, L)`. Instead of computing the node which corresponds to the uniformity of the value, it computes the node which corresponds to the uniformity of the variable we are addressing.

When several edges have to be created we use `X -> {Y, Z}` as a short-hand for `X -> Y, X -> Z`.

Analysis of [[#for-statement|for]] and [[#while-statement|while]] loops follows
from their respective desugaring translations to [[#loop-statement|loop]] statements.

In [[#switch-statement|switch]], a [=default-alone clause=] block is treated exactly like a [=case clause=] with regards to uniformity.

To maximize performance, implementations often try to minimize the amount of
[=uniform control flow|non-uniform control flow=].
However, the points at which invocations can be said to be uniform varies
depending on a number of factors.  WGSL's static analysis conservatively
assumes a return to uniform control flow occuring at the end of
[=statement/if=], [=statement/switch=], and [=statement/loop=] statements if
the [[#behaviors|behavior]] for the statement is {Next}.
This is modeled in the preceding table as the resulting control flow node
being the same as input control flow node.

### Uniformity Rules for Function Calls ### {#uniformity-function-calls}

The most complex rule is for function calls:
- For each argument, apply the corresponding expression rule, with the control flow at the exit of the previous argument (using the control flow at the beginning of the function call for the first argument). Name the corresponding value nodes <dfn noexport>arg_i</dfn> and the corresponding control flow nodes <dfn noexport>CF_i</dfn>
- Create two new nodes, named <dfn noexport>Result</dfn> and <dfn noexport>CF_after</dfn>
- If the [=call site tag=] of the function is [=CallSiteRequiredToBeUniform=], then add an edge from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to the last [=CF_i=]
- Otherwise add an edge from [=CF_after=] to the last [=CF_i=]
- If the [=function tag=] is [=ReturnValueMayBeNonUniform=], then add an edge from [=Result=] to [=MayBeNonUniform=]
- Add an edge from [=Result=] to [=CF_after=]
- For each argument *i*:
    - If the corresponding [=parameter tag=] is [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniform=], then add an edge from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to [=arg_i=]
    - Otherwise if the [=parameter tag=] is [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniformForReturnValue=], then add an edge from [=Result=] to [=arg_i=]
    - If the corresponding parameter has a [=pointer parameter tag=] of [=PointerParameterMayBeNonUniform=], then add an edge from *Vout*(*call*) to [=MayBeNonUniform=]
    - If the parameter is a pointer in the [=address spaces/function=] address space, add an edge from *Vout*(*call*) to each corresponding [=arg_i=] for the reachable parameters recorded previously

Note: Refer to [[#func-var-value-analysis]] for the definition of *Vout*(*call*).

A [[#type-constructor-expr|type constructor expression]] is analyzed as if it were a function call with the same arguments.

Most built-in functions have tags of:
- A [=call site tag=] of [=CallSiteNoRestriction=].
- A [=function tag=] of [=NoRestriction=].
- For each parameter, a [=parameter tag|tag=] of [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniformForReturnValue=].

Here is the list of exceptions:
- All functions in [[#sync-builtin-functions]] have a [=call site tag=] of  [=CallSiteRequiredToBeUniform=].
    - The parameter `p` in [[#workgroupUniformLoad-builtin|workgroupUniformLoad]]
        has a [=parameter tag=] of [=ParameterRequiredToBeUniform=].
- All functions in [[#derivative-builtin-functions]], [[#texturesample]], [[#texturesamplebias]], and [[#texturesamplecompare]] have a [=call site tag=] of [=CallSiteRequiredToBeUniform=] and a [=function tag=] of [=ReturnValueMayBeNonUniform=].
- [[#arrayLength-builtin|arrayLength]] has a [=call site tag=] of
    [=CallSiteNoRestriction=], a [=function tag=] of [=NoRestriction=] and
    the input parameter `p` has a [=parameter tag=] of [=ParameterNoRestriction=]

Note: A WGSL implementation will ensure that if control flow prior to a
function call is [=uniform control flow|uniform=], it will also be uniform
after the function call.

### Uniformity Rules for Expressions ### {#uniformity-expressions}

The rules for analyzing expressions take as argument both the expression itself and the node corresponding to control flow at the beginning of it (which we'll note "CF" below) and return the following:

* A node corresponding to control flow at the exit of it
* A node corresponding to its value
* A set of new nodes and edges to add to the graph

The following built-in input variables are considered uniform:
- [=built-in values/workgroup_id=]
- [=built-in values/num_workgroups=]

All other ones (see [[#builtin-values]]) are considered non-uniform.

Note: An author should avoid grouping the uniform built-in values together with
other non-uniform inputs because the analysis does not analyze the [=components=]
of a [=composite=] type separately.

### Annotating the Uniformity of Every Point in the Control-flow ### {#uniformity-optional-diagnosis-mode}

This entire subsection is non-normative.

If implementers want to provide developers with a diagnostic mode that shows for each point in the control-flow of the entire shader whether it is uniform or not (and thus whether it would be valid to call a function that requires uniformity there), we suggest the following:
- Run the (mandatory, normative) analysis described in the previous subsections, keeping the graph for every function.
- Reverse all edges in all of those graphs
- Go through each function, starting with the entry point and never visiting a function before having visited all of its callers:
    - Add an edge from [=MayBeNonUniform=] to every argument that was non-uniform in at least one caller
    - Add an edge from [=MayBeNonUniform=] to [=CF_start=] if the function was called in non-uniform control-flow in at least one caller
    - Look at which nodes are reachable from [=MayBeNonUniform=]. Every node visited is an expression or point in the control-flow whose uniformity cannot be proven by the analysis

Any node which is not visited by these reachability analyses can be proven to be uniform by the analysis (and so it would be safe to call a derivative or similar function there).

Note: The bottom-up analysis is still required, as it lets us know what edges to add to the graphs when encountering calls.

### Examples ### {#uniformity-examples}

The graphs in the subsequent example use the following conventions for nodes:
* Rectangles represent value nodes.
* Rounded  rectangles represent control flow nodes.

#### Invalid `textureSample` Function Call #### {#uniformity-example1}

This example shows an invalid use of a [[#texturesample|textureSample]]
built-in function call.
The function call is made within an if statement whose condition depends on a
non-uniform value (i.e. the built-in value `position`).
The invalid dependency chain is highlighted in red.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='WGSL invalid textureSample'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @group(0) @binding(0) var t : texture_2d<f32>;
    @group(0) @binding(1) var s : sampler;

    @fragment
    fn main(@builtin(position) pos : vec4<f32>) {
      if (pos.x < 0.5) {
        // Invalid textureSample function call.
        _ = textureSample(t, s, pos.xy);
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class=example1>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Uniformity graph</figcaption>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/uniformity_1.mmd.svg"></object>
  </figure>
</div>

The example also shows that uniformity of the control flow after the if
statement is the same as the uniformity prior to the if statement (CF_return
being connected to [=CF_start=]).
That is, the control flow is once again uniform after the if statement (because
it is guaranteed to start as uniform control flow at the beginning of the entry
point).
If the `textureSample` function call had been moved outside the if statement
the program would have been valid.
Likewise, if the condition of the if statement were a uniform value (e.g. each
invocation read the same value from a [=uniform buffer=]), the program would
also have been valid.

#### Function-scope Variable Uniformity #### {#uniformity-example2}

This example shows both a valid and an invalid
[[#sync-builtin-functions|barrier]] function call that depend on the value of a
function-scope variable.
The `workgroupBarrier` is invalid because the value of `x` is derived from the
mutable module-scope variable `a`.
The `storageBarrier` is valid because the value of `x` is derived from the
immutable module-scope variable `b`.
This example highlights the [[#func-var-value-analysis|value analysis']]
ability to separate different periods of uniformity in a function-scope
variable's lifetime.
This example also clearly shows that control flow becomes uniform again after
the end of the first [=statement/if=] statement.
We know this because that section of the graph is independent from the second
if statement.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='WGSL using function variable'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @group(0) @binding(0) var<storage, read_write> a : i32;
    @group(0) @binding(1) var<uniform> b : i32;

    @compute @workgroup_size(16,1,1)
    fn main() {
      var x : i32;
      x = a;
      if x > 0 {
        // Invalid barrier function call.
        workgroupBarrier();
      }
      x = b;
      if x < 0 {
        // Valid barrier function call.
        storageBarrier();
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class=example2>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Uniformity graph</figcaption>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/uniformity_2.mmd.svg"></object>
  </figure>
</div>

Note: The subgraphs are only included in the example for ease of understanding.


#### Composite Value Analysis Limitations #### {#uniformity-example3}

One limitation of the uniformity analysis is that it does not track the
[=components=] of a [=composite=] value independently.
That is, any non-uniform component value [=behavioral requirement|will=] cause
the analysis to treat the entire composite value as non-uniform.
This example illustrates this issue and a potential workaround that shader
authors can employ to avoid this limitation.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Invalid composite value WGSL'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct Inputs {
      // workgroup_id is a uniform built-in value.
      @builtin(workgroup_id) wgid : vec3<u32>,
      // local_invocation_index is a non-uniform built-in value.
      @builtin(local_invocation_index) lid : u32
    }

    @compute @workgroup_size(16,1,1)
    fn main(inputs : Inputs) {
      // This comparison is always uniform,
      // but the analysis cannot determine that.
      if inputs.wgid.x == 1 {
        workgroupBarrier();
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class=example2>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Invalid uniformity graph</figcaption>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/uniformity_3.mmd.svg"></object>
  </figure>
</div>

The easiest way to work around this limitation of the analysis is to split the
composite up so that values that are known to be uniform are separate from
value that are known to be non-uniform.
In the alternative WGSL below, splitting the two built-in values into separate
parameters satisfies the uniformity analysis.
This can be seen by the lack of a path from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to
[=MayBeNonUniform=] in the graph.

<div class='example wgsl' heading='Valid alternative WGSL'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    @compute @workgroup_size(16,1,1)
    fn main(@builtin(workgroup_id) wgid : vec3<u32>,
            @builtin(local_invocation_index) lid : u32) {
      // The uniformity analysis can now correctly determine this comparison is
      // always uniform.
      if wgid.x == 1 {
        // Valid barrier function call.
        workgroupBarrier();
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class=example3>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Valid alternative uniformity graph</figcaption>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/uniformity_3b.mmd.svg"></object>
  </figure>
</div>

#### Uniformity in a Loop #### {#uniformity-example4}

In this example, there is an invalid `workgroupBarrier` function call in a
loop.
The non-uniform built-in value `local_invocation_index` is the ultimate cause
despite the fact that it appears after the barrier in the loop.
This occurs, because on later iterations some of the invocations in the
workgroup will have exited the loop prematurely while others attempt to execute
the barrier.
The analysis models the inter-iteration dependencies as an edge, where the control
at the start of the loop body (CF_loop_body) depends on the control flow at the
end of the loop body (CF_after_if).

#### User-defined Function Calls #### {#uniformity-example5}

This example is modification of the [[#uniformity-example1|first example]], but
uses a user-defined function call.
The analysis tags both parameters of `scale` as
[=ParameterRequiredToBeUniformForReturnValue=].
This leads to the path in `main` between the return value of the `scale`
function call and the `position` built-in value.
That path is a subpath of the overall invalid path from [=RequiredToBeUniform=] to
[=MayBeNonUniform=].

  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn scale(in1 : f32, in2 : f32) -> f32 {
      let v = in1 / in2;
      return v;
    }

    @group(0) @binding(0) var t : texture_2d<f32>;
    @group(0) @binding(1) var s : sampler;

    @fragment
    fn main(@builtin(position) pos : vec4<f32>) {
      let tmp = scale(pos.x, 0.5);
      if tmp > 1.0 {
        _ = textureSample(t, s, pos.xy);
      }
    }

## Compute Shaders and Workgroups ## {#compute-shader-workgroups}

A <dfn noexport for="compute shader stage">workgroup</dfn> is a set of invocations which
concurrently execute a [=compute shader stage=] [=entry point=],
and share access to shader variables in the [=address spaces/workgroup=] address space.

The <dfn noexport>workgroup grid</dfn> for a compute shader is the set of points
with integer coordinates *(i,j,k)* with:

*  0 &leq; i &lt; workgroup_size_x
*  0 &leq; j &lt; workgroup_size_y
*  0 &leq; k &lt; workgroup_size_z

where *(workgroup_size_x, workgroup_size_y, workgroup_size_z)* is
the value specified for the [=attribute/workgroup_size=] attribute of the
entry point.

There is exactly one invocation in a workgroup for each point in the workgroup grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>local invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding workgroup grid point.

When an invocation has [=local invocation ID=] (i,j,k), then its
<dfn noexport>local invocation index</dfn> is

  i +
  (j * workgroup_size_x) +
  (k * workgroup_size_x * workgroup_size_y)

<p algorithm="local index range">Note that if a workgroup has |W| invocations,
then each invocation |I| the workgroup has a unique local invocation index |L|(|I|)
such that 0 &le; |L|(|I|) &lt; |W|,
and that entire range is covered.</p>

A compute shader begins execution when a WebGPU implementation
removes a dispatch command from a queue and begins the specified work on the GPU.
The dispatch command specifies a <dfn noexport>dispatch size</dfn>,
which is an integer triple *(group_count_x, group_count_y, group_count_z)*
indicating the number of workgroups to be executed, as described in the following.

The <dfn noexport>compute shader grid</dfn> for a particular dispatch
is the set of points with integer coordinates *(CSi,CSj,CSk)* with:

*  0 &leq; CSi &lt; workgroup_size_x &times; group_count_x
*  0 &leq; CSj &lt; workgroup_size_y &times; group_count_y
*  0 &leq; CSk &lt; workgroup_size_z &times; group_count_z

where *workgroup_size_x*,
*workgroup_size_y*, and
*workgroup_size_z* are as above for the compute shader entry point.

The work to be performed by a compute shader dispatch is to execute exactly one
invocation of the entry point for each point in the compute shader grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>global invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding compute shader grid point.

The invocations are organized into workgroups, so that each invocation
*(CSi, CSj, CSk)* is identified with the workgroup grid point

   ( *CSi* mod workgroup_size_x ,
     *CSj* mod workgroup_size_y ,
     *CSk* mod workgroup_size_z )

in <dfn noexport>workgroup ID</dfn>

   ( &lfloor; *CSi* &div; workgroup_size_x &rfloor;,
     &lfloor; *CSj* &div; workgroup_size_y &rfloor;,
     &lfloor; *CSk* &div; workgroup_size_z &rfloor;).

WebGPU provides no guarantees about:

* Whether invocations from different workgroups execute concurrently.
    That is, you cannot assume more than one workgroup executes at a time.
* Whether, once invocations from a workgroup begin executing, that other workgroups
    are blocked from execution.
    That is, you cannot assume that only one workgroup executes at a time.
    While a workgroup is executing, the implementation may choose to
    concurrently execute other workgroups as well, or other queued but unblocked work.
* Whether invocations from one particular workgroup begin executing before
    the invocations of another workgroup.
    That is, you cannot assume that workgroups are launched in a particular order.

## Fragment Shaders and Helper Invocations ## {#fragment-shaders-helper-invocations}

Invocations in the [=fragment shader stage=] are divided into 2x2 grids of
invocations with neighbouring [=built-in values/position|positions=] in the X and Y dimensions.
Each of these grids is referred to as a <dfn noexport>quad</dfn>.
Quads can collaborate in some collective operations (see [[#derivatives]]).

Ordinarily, [[WebGPU#fragment-processing|fragment processing]] creates one
invocation of a fragment shader for each
[=RasterizationPoint=] produced by
[[WebGPU#rasterization|rasterization]].
Sometimes there may be insufficient RasterizationPoints to fully populate a
quad, for example at the edge of a graphics primitive.
When a quad has only 1, 2, or 3 invocations corresponding to
RasterizationPoints, fragment processing [=behavioral requirement|will=] create
a <dfn noexport>helper invocation</dfn> for each unpopulated position in the
quad.

Helper invocations do not have observable effects, except that they help
compute [[#derivatives|derivatives]].
As such, helper invocations are subject to the following restrictions:
* No [=write access|write accesses=] (see also [[#memory-operation]])
    [=behavioral requirement|will=] be performed on the [=address
    spaces/storage=], [=address spaces/workgroup=], or [=address
    spaces/handle=] address spaces.
* [[#atomic-builtin-functions|Atomic built-in functions]] [=behavioral requirement|will=]
    return [=indeterminate value|indeterminate=] results.
* The [=Entry point=] [=return value=] [=behavioral requirement|will=] not be further processed
    downstream in the [=GPURenderPipeline=].

If all of the invocations in a quad become helper invocations (e.g. due to
executing a [=statement/discard=] statement), execution of the quad may be
terminated; however, such termination is not considered to produce [=uniform
control flow|non-uniform control flow=].

## Collective Operations ## {#collective-operations}

### Barriers ### {#barrier}

A barrier is a [[#sync-builtin-functions|synchronization built-in function]]
that orders memory operations in a program.
A <dfn noexport>control barrier</dfn> is executed by all invocations in the
same [=compute shader stage/workgroup=] as if it were executed concurrently.
As such, control barriers [=shader-creation error|must=] only be executed in [=uniform control flow=] in a
[=compute shader stage|compute=] shader.

### Derivatives ### {#derivatives}

A <dfn noexport>partial derivative</dfn> is the rate of change of a value along an axis.
Fragment shader invocations within the same [=quad=] collaborate to compute
approximate partial derivatives.

Partial derivatives of the *fragment coordinate* are computed implicitly as part
of operation of the following built-in functions:
* [[#texturesample|textureSample]],
* [[#texturesamplebias|textureSampleBias]], and
* [[#texturesamplecompare|textureSampleCompare]].

For these, the derivatives help determine the mip levels of texels to be sampled, or in the case of
`textureSampleCompare`, sampled and compared against a reference value.

Partial derivatives of *invocation-specified* values are computed by the
built-in functions described in [[#derivative-builtin-functions]]:
* `dpdx`, `dpdxCoarse`, and `dpdxFine` compute partial derivatives along the x axis.
* `dpdy`, `dpdyCoarse`, and `dpdyFine` compute partial derivatives along the y axis.
* `fwidth`, `fwidthCoarse`, and `fwidthFine` compute the Manhattan metric over the associated x and y partial derivatives.

Because neighbouring invocations collaborate to compute derivatives, these
functions [=shader-creation error|must=] only be invoked in [=uniform control
flow=] in a fragment shader.

## Floating Point Evaluation ## {#floating-point-evaluation}

WGSL follows the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]] standard for floating point computation with
the following exceptions:
* No floating point exceptions are generated.
* Signaling NaNs may not be generated.
    Any signaling NaN may be converted to a quiet NaN.
* Implementations may assume that NaNs and infinities are not present at runtime.
    * In such an implementation, when an expression evaluation would produce an
        infinity or a NaN, an [=indeterminate value=] of the target type is produced instead.
    * It is a [=shader-creation error=] if any [=const-expression=] of
        floating-point type evaluates to NaN or infinity.
    * It is a [=pipeline-creation error=] if any [=override-expression=] of
        floating-point type evaluates to NaN or infinity.
    * Note: This means some functions (e.g. `min` and `max`)
        may not return the expected result due to optimizations about the presence
        of NaNs and infinities.
* Implementations may ignore the sign of a zero.
    That is, a zero with a positive sign may behave like a zero a with a negative sign, and vice versa.
* No rounding mode is specified.
* To <dfn noexport title="flushed to zero">flush to zero</dfn> is to replace a denormalized value for a floating point type
    with a zero value of that type.
    * Any inputs or outputs of operations listed in [[#floating-point-accuracy]] may be flushed to zero.
    * Additionally, intermediate values of operations listed in
        [[#pack-builtin-functions]] or [[#unpack-builtin-functions]] may be flushed to zero.
    * Other operations are required to preserve denormalized numbers.
* The accuracy of operations is given in [[#floating-point-accuracy]].

### Floating Point Accuracy ### {#floating-point-accuracy}

<div algorithm="correctly rounded">
Let |x| be the exact real-valued or infinite result of an operation when computed with unbounded precision.
The <dfn>correctly rounded</dfn> result of the operation for floating point type |T| is:
* |x|, when |x| is in |T|,
* Otherwise:
    * the smallest value in |T| greater than |x|, or
    * the largest value in |T| less than |x|.

</div>

That is, the result may be rounded up or down:
WGSL does not specify a rounding mode.

Note: Floating point types include positive and negative infinity, so
the correctly rounded result may be finite or infinite.

The units in the last place, <dfn noexport>ULP</dfn>, for a floating point
number `x` is the minimum distance between two non-equal floating point numbers
`a` and `b` such that `a` &le; `x` &le; `b` (i.e. `ulp(x) =
min`<sub>`a,b`</sub>`|b - a|`).

In the following tables, the accuracy of an operation is provided among five
possibilities:
* Correct result (for non-floating point return values).
* [=Correctly rounded=].
* A relative error bound expressed as [=ULP=].
* A function that the accuracy is <dfn noexport>inherited from</dfn>.
    That is, the accuracy is equal to implementing the operation in terms of the derived function.
* An absolute error bound.

For any accuracy values specified over a range, the accuracy is undefined for
results outside that range.

If an allowable return value for any operation is greater in magnitude than the
largest representable finite floating-point value, then that operation may additionally
return either the infinity with the same sign or the largest finite
value with the same sign.

<dfn noexport>Reassociation</dfn> is the reordering of operations in an
expression such that the answer is the same if computed exactly. For example:
* `(a + b) + c` reassociates to `a + (b + c)`
* `(a - b) + c` reassociates to `(a + c) - b`
* `(a * b) / c` reassociates to `(a / c) * b`

However, the result may not be the same when computed in floating point.
The reassociated result may be inaccurate due to approximation, or may trigger
an overflow or NaN when computing intermediate results.

An implementation may reassociate operations.

An implementation may fuse operations if the transformed expression is
at least as accurate as the original formulation.
For example, some fused multiply-add implementations can be more accurate
than performing a multiply followed by an addition.

### Floating Point Conversion ### {#floating-point-conversion}

In this section, a floating point type may be any of:
* The [=f32=] and [=f16=] type in WGSL.
* A hypothetical type corresponding to a binary format defined by the [[!IEEE-754|IEEE-754]]
    floating point standard.

Note: Recall that the [=f32=] WGSL type corresponds to the IEEE-754 binary32 format, and the [=f16=] WGSL type corresponds to the IEEE-754 binary16 format.

When converting a floating point scalar value to an [=integer scalar=] type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
* Otherwise, the original value is rounded toward zero.
    * If the rounded value is exactly representable in the destination type, the result is that value.
    * Otherwise, the result is the value in the destination type that is closest to the rounded value.

Note: In other words, floating point to integer conversion rounds toward zero, then saturates.

Note: The result in the overflow case may not yield the value with the maximum magnitude in the target type, because
that value may not be exactly representable in the original floating point type.
For example, the maximum value in [=u32=] is 4294967295, but 4294967295.0 is not exactly representable in `f32`.
For any real number |x| with 4294967040 &leq; |x| &leq; 4294967295,
the f32 value nearest to |x| is either larger than 429467295 or rounds down to 4294967040.
Therefore the maximum u32 value resulting from a floating point conversion is 4294967040u.

When converting a value to a floating point type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
    * Additionally, if the original value is zero and of [=integer scalar=] type, then the resulting value has a zero sign bit.
* Otherwise, the original value is not exactly representable.
    * If the original value is different from but lies between two adjacent finite values representable in the destination type,
         then the result is one of those two values.
         WGSL does not specify whether the larger or smaller representable
         value is chosen, and different instances of such a conversion may choose differently.
    * Otherwise, the original value lies outside the finite range of the destination type:
         * A [=shader-creation error=] results if the original expression is a [=const-expression=].
         * A [=pipeline-creation error=] results if the original expression is an [=override-expression=].
         * Otherwise the conversion proceeds as follows:
             1. Set |X| to the original value.
             2. If the source type is a floating point type with more mantissa bits than the destination type,
                 the extra mantissa bits of the source value *may* be discarded (i.e. treated as if they are 0).
                 Update |X| accordingly.
             3. If |X| is the most-positive or most-negative normal value of the destination type, then the result is |X|.
             4. Otherwise, the result is the infinity value of the destination type, with the same sign as |X|.
    * Otherwise, if the original value is a NaN for the source type, then the result is a NaN in the destination type.

NOTE: An integer value may lie between two adjacent representable floating point values.
In particular, the [=f32=] type uses 23 explicit fractional bits.
Additionally, when the floating point value is in the normal range (the exponent is neither extreme value), then the mantissa is
the set of fractional bits together with an extra 1-bit at the most significant position at bit position 23.
Then, for example, integers 2<sup>28</sup> and 1+2<sup>28</sup> both map to the same floating point value: the difference in the
least significant 1 bit is not representable by the floating point format.
This kind of collision occurs for pairs of adjacent integers with a magnitude of at least 2<sup>25</sup>.

Note: The original value is always within range of the destination type when
the original type is one of [=i32=] or [=u32=] and the destination type is [=f32=].

Note: The original value is always within range of the destination type when
the source type is a floating point type with fewer exponent and mantissa bits than the target floating point type.

Issue: Check behavior of the f32 to f16 conversion for numbers just beyond the max normal f16 values.

# Memory Model # {#memory-model}

In general, WGSL follows the [[!VulkanMemoryModel|Vulkan Memory Model]].
The remainder of this section describes how WGSL programs map to the
Vulkan Memory Model.

Note: The Vulkan Memory Model is a textual version of a [formal Alloy
model](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-MemoryModel/blob/master/alloy/spirv.als).

## Memory Operation ## {#memory-operation}

In WGSL, a [=read access=] is equivalent to a memory read operation in
the Vulkan Memory Model.
A WGSL, a [=write access=] is equivalent to a memory write operation in
the Vulkan Memory Model.

A [=read access=] occurs when an invocation executes one of the following:
* An evaluation of the [=Load Rule=]
* Any [[#texture-builtin-functions|texture builtin function]] except:
    * [[#texturedimensions|textureDimensions]]
    * [[#texturestore|textureStore]]
    * [[#texturenumlayers|textureNumLayers]]
    * [[#texturenumlevels|textureNumLevels]]
    * [[#texturenumsamples|textureNumSamples]]
* Any atomic built-in function except [[#atomic-store|atomicStore]]

A [=write access=] occurs when an invocation executes one of the following:
* An [=statement/assignment=] statement
* A [[#texturestore|textureStore]] built-in function
* Any atomic built-in function except [[#atomic-load|atomicLoad]]
    * [[#atomic-rmw|atomicCompareExchangeWeak]] only performs a write if the
        `exchanged` member of the returned result is `true`

[[#atomic-rmw|Atomic read-modify-write]] built-in functions perform a single
memory operation that is both a [=read access=] and a [=write access=].

Read and write accesses do not occur under any other circumstances.
Read and write accesses are collectively known as [=memory model memory
operation|memory operations=] in the Vulkan Memory Model.

A memory operation accesses exactly the set of [=memory location|locations=]
associated with the particular [=memory view=] used in the operation.  For
example, a memory read that accesses a [=u32=] from a struct containing
multiple members, only reads the memory locations associated with that u32
member.

<div class='example wgsl memory locations accessed' heading="Accessing memory locations">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    struct S {
      a : f32,
      b : u32,
      c : f32
    }

    @group(0) @binding(0)
    var<storage> v : S;

    fn foo() {
      let x = v.b; // Does not access memory locations for v.a or v.c.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

## Memory Model Reference ## {#memory-model-reference}

Each module-scope [=resource=] variable forms a [=memory model reference=] form
the unique [=attribute/group=] and [=attribute/binding=] pair.
Each other variable (i.e. variables in the [=address spaces/function=],
[=address spaces/private=], and [=address spaces/workgroup=] address spaces)
forms a unique [=memory model reference=] for the lifetime of the variable.

## Scoped Operations ## {#scoped-operations}

When an invocation performs a scoped operation, it will affect one or two sets
of invocations.
These sets are the memory scope and the execution scope.  The <dfn
noexport>memory scope</dfn> specifies the set of invocations that will see any
updates to memory contents affected by the operation.
For [[#sync-builtin-functions|synchronization built-in functions]], this also
means that all affected memory operations program ordered before the function
are visible to affected operations program ordered after the function.
The <dfn noexport>execution scope</dfn> specifies the set of invocations which
may participate in an operation (see [[#collective-operations]]).

[[#atomic-builtin-functions|Atomic built-in functions]] map to [=memory model atomic
operation|atomic operations=] whose memory [=memory model scope|scope=] is:
* `Workgroup` if the atomic pointer is in the [=address spaces/workgroup=]
    address space
* `QueueFamily` if the atomic pointer is in the [=address spaces/storage=]
    address space

[[#sync-builtin-functions|Synchronization built-in functions]] map to control
barriers whose execution and memory [=memory model scope|scopes=] are
`Workgroup`.

Implicit and explicit derivatives have an implicit [=quad=] execution scope.

Note: If the Vulkan memory model is not enabled in generated shaders, `Device`
scope should be used instead of `QueueFamily`.

## Memory Semantics ## {#memory-semantics}

All [[#atomic-builtin-functions|Atomic built-in functions]] use `Relaxed`
[=memory model memory semantics|memory semantics=] and, thus, no address space
semantics.

[[#sync-builtin-functions|workgroupBarrier]] uses `AcquireRelease` [=memory
model memory semantics|memory semantics=] and `WorkgroupMemory` semantics.
[[#sync-builtin-functions|storageBarrier]] uses `AcquireRelease` [=memory model
memory semantics|memory semantics=] and `UniformMemory` semantics.

Note: A combined `workgroupBarrier` and `storageBarrier` uses `AcquireRelease`
ordering semantics and both `WorkgroupMemory` and `UniformMemory` memory
semantics.

Note: No atomic or synchronization built-in functions use `MakeAvailable` or
`MakeVisible` semantics.

## Private vs Non-private ## {#private-vs-non-private}

All non-atomic [=read accesses=] in the [=address spaces/storage=] or
[=address spaces/workgroup=] address spaces are considered
[=memory model non-private|non-private=] and correspond to read operations with
`NonPrivatePointer | MakePointerVisible` memory operands with the `Workgroup`
scope.

All non-atomic [=write accesses=] in the [=address spaces/storage=] or
[=address spaces/workgroup=] address spaces are considered
[=memory model non-private|non-private=] and correspond to write operations
with `NonPrivatePointer | MakePointerAvailable` memory operands with the
`Workgroup` scope.

# Built-in Functions # {#builtin-functions}

Certain functions are [=predeclared=], provided by the implementation, and
therefore always available for use in a WGSL program.
These are called <dfn noexport>built-in functions</dfn>.

A built-in function is a family of functions, all with the same name,
but distinguished by the number, order, and types of their [=formal parameters=].
Each of these distinct function variations is an [=overload=].

Note: Each [=user-defined function=] only has one [=overload=].

Each [=overload=] is described below via:
* Type parameterizations, if any.
* The built-in function name, a parenthesized list of [=formal parameters=], and optionally a [=return type=].
* The behavior of this overload of the function.

When calling a built-in function, all arguments to the function are evaluated
before function evaluation begins.
See [[#function-calls]].

**Returns:**

The dimensions of the texture in texels.

For textures based on cubes, the results are the dimensions of each face of the cube.
Cube faces are square, so the x and y components of the result are equal.

If `level` is outside the range `[0, textureNumLevels(t))` then an [=indeterminate value=]
for the return type may be returned.

### `textureGather` ### {#texturegather}

A <dfn noexport>texture gather</dfn> operation reads from a 2D, 2D array, cube, or cube array texture,
computing a four-component vector as follows:
* Find the four texels that would be used in a sampling operation with linear filtering,
    from [=mip level=] 0:
    * Use the specified coordinate, array index (when present), and offset (when present).
    * The texels are adjacent, forming a square, when considering their texture space coordinates (*u*,*v*).
    * Selected texels at the texture edge, cube face edge, or cube corners are handled
        as in ordinary texture sampling.
* For each texel, read one channel and convert it into a scalar value.
    * For non-depth textures, a zero-based `component` parameter specifies the channel to use.
        * If the texture format supports the specified channel, i.e. has more than `component` channels:
             * Yield scalar value `v[component]` when the texel value is `v`.
        * Otherwise:
             * Yield 0.0 when `component` is 1 or 2.
             * Yield 1.0 when `component` is 3 (the alpha channel).
    * For depth textures, yield the texel value. (Depth textures only have one channel.)
* Yield the four-component vector, arranging scalars produced by the previous step into components
    according to the relative coordinates of the texels, as follows:
    * <table>

    * The texels are adjacent, forming a square, when considering their texture space coordinates (*u*,*v*).
    * Selected texels at the texture edge, cube face edge, or cube corners are handled
        as in ordinary texture sampling.
* For each texel, perform a comparison against the depth reference value,
    yielding a 0.0 or 1.0 value, as controlled by the comparison sampler parameters.
* Yield the four-component vector where the components are the comparison results with the texels with
       relative texel coordinates as follows:

**Parameters:**

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [sampled](#sampled-texture-type),
  [multisampled](#multisampled-texture-type), [depth](#texture-depth),
  or [external](#external-texture-type) texture.
  <tr><td>`coords`<td>
  The 0-based texel coordinate.
  <tr><td>`array_index`<td>
  The 0-based texture array index.
  <tr><td>`level`<td>
  The mip level, with level 0 containing a full size version of the texture.
  <tr><td>`sample_index`<td>

**Returns:**

The unfiltered texel data.

An out of bounds access occurs if:
* any element of `coords` is outside the range `[0, textureDimensions(t, level))`
    for the corresponding element, or

* `level` is outside the range `[0, textureNumLevels(t))`, or
* `sample_index` is outside the range `[0, textureNumSamples(s))`

If an out of bounds access occurs, the built-in function returns one of:
* The data for some texel within bounds of the texture
* A vector (0,0,0,0) or (0,0,0,1) of the appropriate type for non-depth textures
* 0.0 for depth textures

</table>

**Parameters:**

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [depth](#texture-depth) texture to sample.
  <tr><td>`s`<td>
  The [sampler comparison](#sampler-type) type.
  <tr><td>`coords`<td>
  The texture coordinates used for sampling.
  <tr><td>`array_index`<td>
  The 0-based texture array index to sample.
  <tr><td>`depth_ref`<td>
  The reference value to compare the sampled depth value against.
  <tr><td>`offset`<td>
  The optional texel offset applied to the unnormalized texture coordinate
  before sampling the texture. This offset is applied before applying any
  texture wrapping modes.<br>
  The `offset` expression [=shader-creation error|must=] be a [=const-expression=] (e.g. `vec2<i32>(1, 2)`).<br>
  Each `offset` component [=shader-creation error|must=] be at least `-8` and at most `7`. Values outside
  of this range will result in a [=shader-creation error=].
</table>

**Returns:**

A value in the range `[0.0..1.0]`.

Each sampled texel is compared against the reference value using the comparison
operator defined by the `sampler_comparison`, resulting in either a `0` or `1`
value for each texel.

If the sampler uses bilinear filtering then the returned value is
the filtered average of these values, otherwise the comparison result of a
single texel is returned.

**Returns:**

A value in the range `[0.0..1.0]`.

The `textureSampleCompareLevel` function is the same as `textureSampleCompare`, except that:

* `textureSampleCompareLevel` always samples texels from mip level 0.
    * The function does not compute derivatives.
    * There is no requirement for `textureSampleCompareLevel` to be invoked in [=uniform control flow=].
* `textureSampleCompareLevel` may be invoked in any shader stage.

  <tr><td>`array_index`<td>
  The 0-based texture array index to sample.
  <tr><td>`level`<td>
  The mip level, with level 0 containing a full size version of the texture.
  For the functions where `level` is a `f32`, fractional values may interpolate
  between two levels if the format is filterable according to the
  [Texture Format Capabilities](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#texture-format-caps).
  <tr><td>`offset`<td>

</table>

**Parameters:**

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [sampled](#sampled-texture-type) or [external](#external-texture-type) texture to sample.
  <tr><td>`s`<td>
  The [sampler type](#sampler-type).
  <tr><td>`coords`<td>
  The texture coordinates used for sampling.

  Before sampling, the given coordinates [=behavioral requirement|will=] be clamped to the rectangle

  > [ *half_texel*, 1 - *half_texel* ]

  where

  >  *half_texel* = vec2(0.5) / vec2&lt;f32&gt;(textureDimensions(t))

  Note: The half-texel adjustment ensures that,
  independent of the sampler's {{GPUAddressMode|addressing}}
  and {{GPUFilterMode|filter}} modes,
  wrapping will not occur.
  That is, when sampling near an edge, the sampled texels
  will be at or adjacent to that edge, and not selected from the opposite edge.

## Atomic Built-in Functions ## {#atomic-builtin-functions}

Atomic built-in functions can be used to read/write/read-modify-write atomic
objects. They are the only operations allowed on [[#atomic-types]].

All atomic built-in functions use a `relaxed` [[#memory-semantics|memory
ordering]].  This means synchronization and ordering guarantees only apply among
atomic operations acting on the same [=memory locations=].  No synchronization
or ordering guarantees apply between atomic and non-atomic memory accesses, or
between atomic accesses acting on different memory locations.

Atomic built-in functions [=shader-creation error|must not=] be used in a [=vertex=] shader stage.

The address space `AS` of the `atomic_ptr` parameter in all atomic built-in
functions [=shader-creation error|must=] be either [=address spaces/storage=] or [=address spaces/workgroup=].

|T| [=shader-creation error|must=] be either [=u32=] or [=i32=]

### Atomic Load ### {#atomic-load}

```rust
fn atomicLoad(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>) -> T
```

Returns the atomically loaded the value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
It does not [=atomic modification|modify=] the object.

### Atomic Store ### {#atomic-store}

```rust
fn atomicStore(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T)
```

Atomically stores the value `v` in the atomic object pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.

### Atomic Read-modify-write ### {#atomic-rmw}

```rust
fn atomicAdd(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicSub(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicMax(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicMin(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicAnd(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicOr(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
fn atomicXor(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
```
Each function performs the following steps atomically:

1. Load the original value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
2. Obtains a new value by performing the operation (e.g. max) from the function
    name with the value |v|.
3. Store the new value using `atomic_ptr`.

Each function returns the original value stored in the atomic object.

```rust
fn atomicExchange(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, v: T) -> T
```

Atomically stores the value `v` in the atomic object pointed to
`atomic_ptr` and returns the original value stored in the atomic object.

```rust
fn atomicCompareExchangeWeak(atomic_ptr: ptr<AS, atomic<T>, read_write>, cmp: T, v: T) -> __atomic_compare_exchange_result<T>

struct __atomic_compare_exchange_result<T> {
  old_value : T; // old value stored in the atomic
  exchanged : bool; // true if the exchange was done
}
```

Note: A value cannot be explicitly declared with the type
`__atomic_compare_exchange_result`, but a value may infer the type.

Performs the following steps atomically:

1. Load the original value pointed to by `atomic_ptr`.
2. Compare the original value to the value `cmp` using an equality operation.
3. Store the value `v` `only if` the result of the equality comparison was `true`.

Returns a two member structure, where the first member, `old_value`, is the
original value of the atomic object and the second member, `exchanged`, is
whether or not the comparison succeeded.

Note: The equality comparison may spuriously fail on some implementations. That
is, the second component of the result vector may be `false` even if the first
component of the result vector equals `cmp`.

## Data Packing Built-in Functions ## {#pack-builtin-functions}

Data packing builtin functions can be used to encode values using data formats that
do not correspond directly to types in WGSL.
This enables a program to write many densely packed values to memory, which can
reduce a shader's memory bandwidth demand.

Each builtin applies the *inverse* of a [=channel transfer function=] to several input values, then combines
their results into a single output value.

Note: For packing unorm values, the normalized floating point values are in the interval [0.0, 1.0].

Note: For packing snorm values, the normalized floating point values are in the interval [-1.0, 1.0].

Data unpacking builtin functions can be used to decode values in
data formats that do not correspond directly to types in WGSL.
This enables a program to read many densely packed values from memory, which can

Each builtin breaks up an input value into channels, then applies a [=channel transfer function=] to each.

Note: For unpacking unorm values, the normalized floating point result is in the interval [0.0, 1.0].

Note: For unpacking snorm values, the normalized floating point result is in the interval [-1.0, 1.0].

Acquire/Release [[#memory-semantics|memory ordering]].
That is, all synchronization functions, and affected memory and atomic
operations are ordered in [[#program-order|program order]] relative to the
synchronization function.

the synchronization function must be visible to all other threads in the
workgroup before any affected memory or atomic operation program-ordered after
the synchronization function is executed by a member of the workgroup.

All synchronization functions use the `Workgroup` [=memory scope=].<br>

# Grammar for Recursive Descent Parsing # {#grammar-recursive-descent}

This section is non-normative.

The WGSL grammar is specified in a form suitable for an LALR(1) parser.
An implementation may want to use a recursive-descent parser instead.

The normative grammar cannot be used directly in a recursive-descent parser, because
several of its rules are left-recursive.
A grammar rule is directly left-recursive when the nonterminal being defined appears first
in one of its productions.

The following is the WGSL grammar, but mechanically transformed to:
* Eliminate direct and indirect left-recursion.
* Avoid empty productions. (That is, avoid epsilon-rules.)
* Bring together common prefixes among sibling productions.

However, it is not LL(1).
For some nonterminals, several productions have common lookahead sets.
For example, all productions for the `attribute` nonterminal start with the `attr` token.
A more subtle example is `global_decl`, where three productions start with an `attribute *`
phrase, but then are distinguished by tokens `fn`, `override`, and `var`.


For the sake of brevity, many token definitions are not repeated.
Use token definitions from the main part of the specification.

# Appendix A: The `text/wgsl` Media Type # {#text-wgsl-media-type}

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of media types, at [[IANA-MEDIA-TYPES]].

The following is the definition of the `text/wgsl` media type for WGSL programs.
It has been registered at IANA,
appearing at [https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/wgsl](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/wgsl).
