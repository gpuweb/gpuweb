# Introduction # {#intro}

WebGPU Shader Language ([SHORTNAME]) is the shader language for [[!WebGPU]].
That is, an application using the WebGPU API uses [SHORTNAME] to express the programs, known as shaders,
that run on the GPU.

<div class='example'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    [[location(0)]] var<out> gl_FragColor : vec4<f32>;
    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn main() -> void {
        gl_FragColor = vec4<f32>(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0);
    }
  </xmp>
</div>


## Goals ## {#goals}

 * Trivially convertable to SPIR-V
 * Constructs are defined as normative references to their SPIR-V counterparts
 * All features in [SHORTNAME] are directly translatable to SPIR-V. (No polymorphism, no general pointers, no overloads, etc)
 * Features and semantics are exactly the ones of SPIR-V
 * Each item in this spec *must* provide the mapping to SPIR-V for the construct

## Technical Overview TODO ## {#technical-overview}

## Notation ## {#notation}

The <dfn noexport>floor expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x|:

* &lfloor;|x|&rfloor; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k| &le; |x| &lt; |k|+1

The <dfn noexport>ceiling expression</dfn> is defined over real numbers |x|:

* &lceil;|x|&rceil; = |k|, where |k| is the unique integer such that |k|-1 &lt; |x| &le; |k|

The <dfn noexport>roundUp</dfn> function is defined for positive integers |k| and |n| as:

* roundUp(|k|, |n|) = &lceil;|n| &div; |k|&rceil; &times; |k|

# Textual structure TODO # {#textual-structure}

TODO: This is a stub.

A [SHORTNAME] program is text.
This specification does not prescribe a particular encoding for that text.

## Comments ## {#comments}

Comments begin with a `#` and continue to the end of the current line. There are no multi-line comments.

TODO: What indicates the end of a line?  (E.g. A line ends at the next linefeed or at the end of the program)

## Tokens TODO ## {#tokens}

## Literals TODO ## {#literals}

<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Token<th>Definition
  </thead>
  <tr><td>`FLOAT_LITERAL`<td>`(-?[0-9]*.[0-9]+ | -?[0-9]+.[0-9]*)((e|E)(+|-)?[0-9]+)?`
  <tr><td>`INT_LITERAL`<td>`-?0x[0-9a-fA-F]+ | 0 | -?[1-9][0-9]*`
  <tr><td>`UINT_LITERAL`<td>`0x[0-9a-fA-F]+u | 0u | [1-9][0-9]*u`
  <tr><td>`STRING_LITERAL`<td>`"[^"]*"`
</table>

Note: literals are parsed greedy. This means that for statements like `a -5`
      this will *not* parse as `a` `minus` `5` but instead as `a` `-5` which
      may be unexpected. A space must be inserted after the `-` if the first
      expression is desired.

      this will *not* parse as `a` `minus` `5` but instead as `a` `-5` which

      expression is desired.

## Attributes TODO ## {#attributes}

## Declarations TODO ## {#declarations}

TODO: This is a stub.

(Forward Reference) A name can denote a value, a type, a function, or a variable.

### Scoping ### {#scoping}

A declaration introduces a name, given by an identifier token.
Scoping is the set of rules determining where that name may be used, in relation to
the position of the declaration in the program.
If a name may be used at a particular point in the program, then we say it is <dfn dfn noexport>in scope</dfn>.

Issue: (dneto) also lifetime.

There are multiple levels of scoping depending on how and where things are
declared.

A declaration must not introduce a name when that name is already in scope at the start
of the declaration.
That is, shadow names are not allowed in [SHORTNAME].


# Types # {#types}

Note: For the syntax of declaring types in [SHORTNAME] please see the [[#grammar]].
TODO(dneto): This note is probably editorially obsolete.

Programs calculate values. Each value in [SHORTNAME] belongs to exactly one *type*.
A type is a set of (mathematical) values.

We distinguish between the concept of a type and the syntax in [SHORTNAME] to denote that type.
In many cases the spelling of a type in this document is the same as its [SHORTNAME] syntax.
The spelling is different for structure types, or types containing structures.

## Type Checking ## {#type-checking}

Type checking is the process of mapping terms in the [SHORTNAME] source language to [[#types]].

Generally, we start by determining types for the smallest [SHORTNAME] source phrases, and then build up
via combining rules.

If we can derive a type for the whole [SHORTNAME] source program via the type rules, then we say
the program is *well-typed*.  Otherwise there is a type error and is not a valid
[SHORTNAME] program.


Issue: (dneto) complete

### Explanation for those familiar with formal type checking ### {#type-check-preamble}

Much of it can be bottom-up, like usual.

The interesting bit is that the type of a pointer expression is either straightforward pointer
type itself, or the pointee type, depending on its [[#pointer-evaluation]] context:

* In Indexing, Assigning (LValue), and Copying contexts, the pointer expression denotes a pointer value.
* In a Parameter context:
 * If the parameter type matches the pointer expression's straightforward pointer type, then the expression denotes that pointer type.
 * Otherwise the pointer expression denotes a value of the pointee type, being the value loaded (at that time) from the referenced storage.
* In a Reading (RValue) context, the pointer expression denotes a value of the pointee type.

### How to read type-checking rules ### {#type-check-how-to-read}

A *type assertion* is a mapping from some [SHORTNAME] source expression to an [SHORTNAME] type.
When this specification has

> *e* : *T*

we are saying the [SHORTNAME] expression *e* is of type *T*.
In the type rules, the [SHORTNAME] source expression will often have placeholders in *italics* that
represent sub-expressions in the grammar.

In the type checking tables, each row represents a type deduction rule:
If the conditions in the precondition column are satisfied, then
the type assertion in the conclusion column is also satisfied.

For convenience, we will use the following shorthands:

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>*Scalar*<td>[=scalar=] types: one of bool, i32, u32, f32
  <tr><td>*BoolVec*<td>[[#vector-types]] with bool component
  <tr><td>*Int*<td>i32 or u32
  <tr><td>*IntVec*<td>[[#vector-types]] with an *Int* component
  <tr><td>*Integral*<td>*Int* or [[#vector-types]] with an *Int* component
  <tr><td>*SignedIntegral*<td>i32 or [[#vector-types]] with an i32 component
  <tr><td>*FloatVec*<td>[[#vector-types]] with f32 component
  <tr><td>*Floating*<td>f32 or *FloatVec*
  <tr><td>*Arity(T)*<td>number of components in [[#vector-types]] *T*
</table>



## Void Type ## {#void-type}

The <dfn noexport>void</dfn> type contains no values.

It is used where a type is required by the language but where no values are produced or consumed.
For example, it is used for the return type of a function which does not produce a value.

## Value Types ## {#value-types}

### Boolean Type ### {#bool-type}

The <dfn dfn noexport>bool</dfn> type contains the values true and false.

### Integer Types ### {#integer-types}

The <dfn dfn noexport>u32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit unsigned integers.

The <dfn noexport>i32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit signed integers.
It uses a two's complementation representation, with the sign bit in the most significant bit position.

### Floating Point Type ### {#floating-point-types}

The <dfn noexport>f32</dfn> type is the set of 32-bit floating point values of the IEEE 754 binary32 (single precision) format.
See [[#floating-point-evaluation]] for details.

### Scalar Types ### {#scalar-types}

The <dfn dfn noexport>scalar</dfn> types are [=bool=], [=i32=], [=u32=], and [=f32=].

The <dfn dfn noexport>numeric scalar</dfn> types are [=i32=], [=u32=], and [=f32=].

### Vector Types ### {#vector-types}
<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td>vec*N*<*T*><td>Vector of *N* elements of type *T*.
                          *N* must be in {2, 3, 4} and *T*
                          must be one of the [=scalar=] types.
                          We say *T* is the component type of the vector
</table>

A vector type is a <dfn dfn>numeric vector</dfn> type if its component type is a [=numeric scalar=].

<div class='example' heading='Vector'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    vec2<f32>  # is a vector of two f32s.
  </xmp>
</div>

### Matrix Types ### {#matrix-types}
<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td>mat*N*x*M*<*T*><td>Matrix of *N* columns and *M* rows, where
                                *N* and *M* are both in {2, 3, 4}.
                                *T* must be *f32*.
</table>

<div class='example' heading='Matrix'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    mat2x3<f32>  # is a 2 column, 3 row matrix of 32-bit floats.
  </xmp>
</div>

### Array Types ### {#array-types}
<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td>array<*E*,*N*><td>An *N*-element array of elements of type *E*.<br>
  <tr><td>array<*E*><td>A <dfn noexport>runtime-sized</dfn> array of elements of type *E*,
                       also known as a runtime array.
                       These may only appear in specific contexts.<br>
</table>

Restrictions on runtime-sized arrays:
* The last member of the structure type defining the [=store type=]
    for a variable in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class may be a runtime-sized array.
* A runtime-sized array must not be used as the store type or contained within
    a store type in any other cases.
* The type of an expression must not be a runtime-sized array type.

Issue: (dneto): Complete description of `Array<E,N>`

### Structure Types ### {#struct-types}
<table class='data'>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Description
  </thead>
  <tr><td>struct<*T1*,...,*Tn*><td>An ordered tuple of *N* members of types

                                    integer greater than 0.
</table>

<div class='example' heading="Structure">

         Indicates this structure type represents the contents of a
         buffer resource occupying a single binding slot in the
         [=resource interface of a shader|shader's resource interface=].
         The `block` attribute must be applied to a structure type used
         as the [=store type=] of a [=uniform buffer=] or [=storage buffer=] variable.
</table>

A structure type with the [=block=] attribute must not be:
* the element type of an array type.
* the member type in another structure.

## Memory TODO ## {#memory}

TODO: This section is a stub.

In [SHORTNAME], a value of [=storable=] type may be stored in memory, for later retrieval.

In general [SHORTNAME] follows the [[!VulkanMemoryModel|Vulkan Memory Model]]
with the following exceptions

 * No Acquire/Release semantics

### Memory Locations TODO ### {#memory-locations}

TODO: *This is a stub*

Memory consists of distinct locations.

### Storable Types ### {#storable-types}

The following types are <dfn dfn noexport>storable</dfn>:

* [[#scalar-types]]
* [[#vector-types]]
* [[#matrix-types]]
* [[#array-types]] if its element type is storable.
* [[#struct-types]] if all its members are storable.

### IO-shareable Types ### {#io-shareable-types}

The following types are <dfn dfn noexport>IO-shareable</dfn>:

* [=numeric scalar=] types
* [=numeric vector=] types
* [[#matrix-types]]
* [[#array-types]] if its element type is IO-shareable, and the array is not [=runtime-sized=]
* [[#struct-types]] if all its members are IO-shareable

The following kinds of values must be of IO-shareable type:

* Values read from or written to built-in variables.
* Values accepted as inputs from an upstream pipeline stage.
* Values written as output for downstream processing in the pipeline, or to an output attachment.

### Host-shareable Types ### {#host-shareable-types}

Host-shareable types are used to describe the contents of buffers which are shared between
the host and the GPU, or copied between host and GPU without format translation.
When used for this purpose, the type must be additionally decorated with layout attributes
as described in [[#memory-layouts]].
We will see in [[#module-scope-variables]] that the [=store type=] of [=uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=]
variables must be host-shareable.

The following types are <dfn dfn noexport>host-shareable</dfn>:

* [=numeric scalar=] types
* [=numeric vector=] types
* [[#matrix-types]]
* [[#array-types]] if the array type has a [=stride=] attribute and its element type is host-shareable
* [[#struct-types]] if each member is host-shareable and has an [=offset=] attribute

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Layout attributes, for host-shareable types</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Decoraton<th>Operand<th>Description
  </thead>

  <tr><td><dfn noexport>`stride`</dfn>
      <td>positive i32 literal
      <td>Applied to an array type.<br>
         The number of bytes from the start of one element of the array to the
         start of the next element.
  <tr><td><dfn noexport>`offset`</dfn>
      <td>non-negative i32 literal
      <td>Applied to a member of a structure type.<br>
         The number of bytes between the start of the structure and the location
         of this member.
</table>

Note: An [=IO-shareable=] type would also be host-shareable if it and its subtypes have
the approporate [=stride=] and [=offset=] attributes.
Additionally, a [=runtime-sized=] array is host-shareable but is not IO-shareable.

Note: Both IO-shareable and host-shareable types have concrete sizes, but counted differently.
IO-shareable types are sized by a location-count metric, see [[#input-output-locations]].
Host-shareable types are sized by a byte-count metric, see [[#memory-layouts]].

### Storage Classes ### {#storage-class}

Memory locations are partitioned into <dfn noexport>storage classes</dfn>.
Each storage class has unique properties determining
mutability, visibility, the values it may contain,
and how to use variables with it.

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Storage Classes</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Storage class

### Memory Layout ### {#memory-layouts}

[=Uniform buffer=] and [=storage buffer=] variables are used to share
bulk data organized as a sequence of bytes in memory.
Buffers are shared between the CPU and the GPU, or between different shader stages
in a pipeline, or between different pipelines.

Because buffer data are shared without reformatting or translation,
buffer producers and consumers must agree on the <dfn noexport>memory layout</dfn>,
which is the description of how the bytes in a buffer are organized into typed [SHORTNAME] values.

The [=store type=] of a buffer variable must be [=host-shareable=], with fully elaborated memory layout, as described below.

Each buffer variable must be declared in either the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage classes.

The memory layout of a type is significant only when evaluating an expression with:
* a variable in the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage class, or
* a pointer into the [=storage classes/uniform=] or [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.

An 8-bit byte is the most basic unit of [=host-shareable=] memory.
The terms defined in this section express counts of 8-bit bytes.

We will use the following notation:

* |Stride|(|A|) is the value of the [=stride=] attribute of array type |A|.
* |Offset|(|S|,|i|) is the value of the [=offset=] attribute of the |i|'th member of structure type |S|.

The remainder of this section is structured as follows:
* Section [[#memory-layout-intent]] describes the intent of the layout rules.  It is not normative.
* Section [[#internal-value-layout]] says how the internals of a value are placed in byte memory
    locations starting from a given byte offset in a buffer.  For composite types the layout
    depends on the properties of the type itself, the storage class, and the user-specified
    [=stride=] and [=offset=] attributes.
* Section [[#layout-constraints]] describes the contraints on array strides and structure member
    offsets, ultimately yielding definitions for
    [=uniform buffer layout=] and [=storage buffer layout=].

#### Memory Layout Intent #### {#memory-layout-intent}

This section is informative, not normative.

The layout rules describe two sets of constraints, one for uniform buffers and one for storage buffers.
They are similar in many respects, but the uniform buffer layout is more restrictive.

In particular:
* Scalar data values are aligned to their own size.
* There is no padding between components of a vector.
* Two-element and four-element vectors are aligned to their size.
* Three-element vectors are aligned as if they were four-element vectors.
* An array's element alignment is a multiple of the element type's alignment.
    * In a uniform buffer, the array element alignment is also a multiple of 16.
* An array's alignment is the same as its element alignment.
* A matrix with |N| columns is aligned as if it were an array of |N| column vectors.
* A structure inherits the worst-case alignment of any of its members.
    * In a uniform buffer, the structure alignment is also a multiple of 16.
* The members of a structure are laid out in order: earlier members are appear earlier in
    the buffer

Additionally we define a value's allocation extent, or memory footprint, which determines
how many memory locations must be reserved to store that value in host-shareable memory.
Allocation extent is a determining factor of the minimum size of a buffer that can be bound
to a uniform buffer variable
or to a storage buffer variable.
See [[#resource-layout-compatibility]].

Compared to OpenGL:
* For any type, OpenGL `std140` layout is the same as using the tightest offset and stride assignments in [SHORTNAME] [=uniform buffer layout=].
* For any type, OpenGL `std430` layout is the same as using the tightest offset and stride assignments in [SHORTNAME] [=storage buffer layout=].
* OpenGL supports row-major matrices, but [SHORTNAME] does not.

Compared to [[Vulkan1.2ext|Vulkan &sect; 15.6.4 Offset and Stride Assignment]]:
* Vulkan *standard buffer layout* maps to [SHORTNAME] [=standard buffer layout rules=] with the following qualifications:
    * Vulkan allows a vector to be aligned to the size of its scalar component, but [SHORTNAME] requires a more constrained alignment.
    * The Vulkan `scalarBlockLayout` and `uniformBufferStandardLayout` features do not apply to [SHORTNAME].
    * The Vulkan concept of *scalar alignment* does not correspond to a concept in [SHORTNAME];
* The Vulkan *base alignment* for a type |S| corresponds to the [SHORTNAME] alignment requirement for |S| in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class: |Align|(|S|,`storage`).
* The Vulkan *extended alignment* for a type |S| corresponds to the [SHORTNAME] alignment requirement for |S| in the [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class: |Align|(|S|,`uniform`).
* The Vulkan concept of *improperly straddle* is not permitted in [SHORTNAME], because [SHORTNAME] requires vectors to be aligned to their whole size.
* Vulkan supports non-32-bit scalar types and vector types with non-32-bit components, but [SHORTNAME] does not.
* Vulkan supports row-major matrices, but [SHORTNAME] does not.
* Vulkan allows offsets to be non-monotonic, but [SHORTNAME] does not.

#### Internal Layout of Values #### {#internal-value-layout}

This section describes how the internals of a value are placed in the byte locations
of a buffer, given an assumed placement of the overall value.
These layouts depend on the value's type, the storage class of the buffer,
the [=stride=] attribute on array types, and the [=offset=] attribute on structure type
members.

Note: Matrix values are laid out more compactly in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class
than in the [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class.

A type can be used for values in both [=storage classes/uniform=] and [=storage classes/storage=] storage classes.
This is valid as long as the layout constraints are satisifed for both storage classes.
The data will appear identically in both storage classes, except for the case of matrices noted above.

When a value |V| of type [=u32=] or [=i32=] is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+2 contains bits 16 through 23 of |V|
   * Byte |k|+3 contains bits 24 through 31 of |V|

Note: Recall that [=i32=] uses twos-complement representation, so the sign bit
is in bit position 31.

A value |V| of type [=f32=] is represented in IEEE 754 binary32 format.
It has one sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23 fraction bits.
When |V| is placed at byte offset |k| of host-shared buffer, then:
   * Byte |k| contains bits 0 through 7 of the fraction.
   * Byte |k|+1 contains bits 8 through 15 of the fraction.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+2 contain bits 16 through 23 of the fraction.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+2 contains bit 0 bit of the exponent.
   * Bits 0 through 6 of byte |k|+3 contain bits 1 through 7 of the exponent.
   * Bit 7 of byte |k|+3 contains the sign bit.

Note: The above rules imply that numeric values in host-shared buffers
are stored in little-endian format.

When a value |V| of vector type vec|N|&lt;|T|&gt; is placed at
byte offset |k| of a host-shared buffer, then:
   * |V|.x is placed at byte offset |k|
   * |V|.y is placed at byte offset |k|+4
   * If |N| &ge; 3, then |V|.z is placed at byte offset |k|+8
   * If |N| &ge; 4, then |V|.w is placed at byte offset |k|+12

When a matrix value |M| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer in
the [=storage classes/storage=] [=storage class=], then:
   * If |M| has 2 rows, then:
      * Column vector |i| of |M| is placed at byte offset |k| + 8 &times; |i|
   * If |M| has 3 or 4 rows, then:
      * Column vector |i| of |M| is placed at byte offset |k| + 16 &times; |i|

When a matrix value |M| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer in
the [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class, then:
   * Column vector |i| of |M| is placed at byte offset |k| + 16 &times; |i|

When a value of array type |A| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * Element |i| of the array is placed at byte offset |k| + |i| &times; |Stride|(|A|)

When a value of structure type |S| is placed at byte offset |k| of a host-shared memory buffer,
then:
   * The |i|'th member of the structure value is placed at byte offset |k| + |Offset|(|S|,|i|)

#### Layout Constraints and Standard Buffer Layout #### {#layout-constraints}

This section defines a standard buffer layout, parameterized on storage class,
and the associated constraints on array strides and structure member offsets.
It also provides a way to compute the number of bytes occupied by a buffer variable
and by its internal components.

The <dfn noexport>alignment</dfn> of a type constrains
the byte index at which a value of that type
may be placed relative to the start of the host-shareable buffer.
The constraint is expressed below, after other necessary terms are also defined.
Alignment is a function of both the type and the [=storage class=] of the buffer.

We write |Align|(|S|,|C|) for the alignment of host-shareable
type |S| in storage class |C|, where |C| is either [=storage classes/storage=] or [=storage classes/storage=].
It is defined recursively in the following table:

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Alignment of a host-shareable type</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Host-shareable type |S|
        <th>|Align|(|S|,`storage`)
        <th>|Align|(|S|,`uniform`)
  </thead>
  <tr><td>[=i32=], [=u32=], or [=f32=]
      <td>4
      <td>4

      <td>16
      <td>16
  <tr><td>vec4&lt;|T|&gt;,

      <td>mat|N|x4&lt;f32&gt;
      <td>16
      <td>16
  <tr algorithm="alignment of an array">
      <td>array<|T|,|N|>
      <td>|Align|(|T|,`storage`)
      <td>[=roundUp=](16, |Align|(|T|,`uniform`))
  <tr algorithm="alignment of an runtime-sized array">
      <td>array<|T|>
      <td>|Align|(|T|,`storage`)
      <td>[=roundUp=](16, |Align|(|T|,`uniform`))
  <tr algorithm="alignment of a structure">
      <td>struct&lt;|T1|,...,|Tn|&gt;
      <td>max(|Align|(|T1|,`storage`),..., |Align|(|Tn|,`storage`))
      <td>roundUp(16, |A|),<br> where |A| = max(|Align|(|T1|,`uniform`),..., |Align|(|Tn|,`uniform`)))
</table>

The <dfn>allocation extent</dfn> of a value |V|
is the number of contiguous bytes reserved in host-shareable memory
for the purpose of storing |V|.
It is a function of the type of |V|, the size of any runtime-sized array that |V| may
contain, and the [=storage class=] of the buffer.

Note: The allocation extent may include padding inserted to satisfy alignment rules.
Consequently, loads and stores of a value might access fewer memory locations
than value's allocation extent.

We write |Extent|(|V|,|C|) for the allocation extent of value |V|
of host-shareable type |S| in storage class |C|,
where |C| is either [=storage classes/storage=] or [=storage classes/storage=].
It is defined recursively in the following table:

<table class='data'>
  <caption>Allocation extent of a value of host-shareable type</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Host-shareable type |S|
        <th>|Extent|(|V|,`storage`)<br>where |V| is of type |S|
        <th>|Extent|(|V|,`uniform`)<br>where |V| is of type |S|
  </thead>
  <tr><td>[=i32=], [=u32=], or [=f32=]
      <td>4
      <td>4
  <tr><td>vec|N|&lt;|T|&gt;,
      where |T| is one of [=i32=], [=u32=], or [=f32=]
      <td>|N| &times; 4
      <td>|N| &times; 4
  <tr algorithm="extent of a matrix with 2 rows">

      <td>mat|N|x4&lt;f32&gt;
      <td>|N| &times; 16
      <td>|N| &times; 16
  <tr algorithm="extent of an array">
      <td>array&lt;<var ignore>T</var>,|N|>
      <td>|N| &times; |Stride|(|S|)
      <td>|N| &times; |Stride|(|S|)
  <tr algorithm="extent of an runtime-sized array">
      <td>array&lt;<var ignore>T</var>&gt;
      <td>|N|<sub>runtime</sub> &times; |Stride|(|S|),<br>
where |N|<sub>runtime</sub> is the runtime-determined number of elements of <var ignore>V</var>
      <td>Not applicable:  [=runtime-sized=] arrays cannot appear in [=storage classes/storage=] storage
  <tr algorithm="extent of a structure">
      <td>struct&lt;|T|<sub>1</sub>,...,|T|<sub>|n|</sub>&gt;
      <td>[=roundUp=](|Align|(|S|,`storage`),|L|),<br>
      where |L|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|Offset|(|S|,|n|)&nbsp;+&nbsp;|Extent|(|V|<sub>|n|</sub>,`storage`)),<br>
      and |V|<sub>|n|</sub> is the last member of |V|
      <td>[=roundUp=](|Align|(|S|,`uniform`),|L|),<br>
      where |L|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|Offset|(|S|,|n|)&nbsp;+&nbsp;|Extent|(|V|<sub>|n|</sub>,`uniform`)),<br>
      and |V|<sub>|n|</sub> is the last member of |V|
</table>

When a type |S| is not a runtime-sized array and it does not contain a runtime-sized array, then
all values |V| of type |S| will have the same allocation extent for a storage class |C|.
In these cases we define the allocation extent of the *type* |S| as that common value:
|Extent|(|S|,|C|) = |Extent|(|V|,|C|), for any |V| of type |S|.

Note: When underlying the target is a Vulkan device, we assume the device does
not support the `scalarBlockLayout` feature.
Therefore, a data value must not be placed in the padding at the end of a structure or matrix,
nor in the padding at the last element of an array.
Counting such padding as part of the allocation extent allows [SHORTNAME] to capture this constraint.

Host-shareable type |S| satisfies <dfn noexport>standard buffer layout rules</dfn> for storage class |C|
when:
* If |S| is a structure type struct&lt;|T|<sub>1</sub>,...,|T|<sub>|n|</sub>&gt;, then it satisfies
    standard buffer layout rules for |C| when all the following are satisifed:
    * Each member type |T|<sub>|i|</sub> satisfies standard buffer layout rules for |C|
    * Members do not overlap, and are laid out in declaration order:
        <p algorithm="member offsets increase and prevent overlap">
            |Offset|(|S|,|i|) + <var ignore>Extent</var>(|T|<sub>|i|</sub>,<var ignore>C</var>)
            &le; |Offset|(|S|,|i|+1), for 1 &le; |i| &lt; <var ignore>n</var>
        </p>
    * If the structure is aligned, then members will also be aligned:
        <p algorithm="member alignment">
            |Offset|(|S|,|i|)
            = |k| &times; <var ignore>Align</var>(|T|<sub>|i|</sub>,<var ignore>C</var>),
            for some non-negative integer |k|
        </p>
* If |S| is an array type `array`&lt;|E|,|N|&gt; or `array`&lt;|E|&gt;, then it satisfies
    standard buffer layout rules for |C| when all the following are satisifed:
    * Element type |E| satisfies standard buffer layout rules for |C|
    * The stride ensures elements don't overlap:
        <p algorithm="stride prevents overlap">
        |Stride|(|S|) &ge; |Extent|(|E|,<var ignore>C</var>)
        </p>
    * If the array is aligned, then each array element is aligned:
        <p algorithm="stride respects array element alignment">
        |Stride|(|S|) = |k| &times; |Align|(|E|,<var ignore>C</var>), for some positive integer |k|
        </p>
    * For the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class, array elements are aligned to 16 byte boundaries:
        <p algorithm="16-byte array element alignment">
            If <var ignore>C</var> is [=storage classes/storage=], then
            |Stride|(|S|)
            = |k| &times; 16 for some non-negative integer |k|
        </p>
* Other host-shareable types |S| are not futher constrained.
    They always satisfy standard buffer layout rules.

Note: The consistency and completeness of these rules rely on the fact
that a [=runtime-sized=] array may *only* appear as the last
element of a structure that is the store type for a buffer variable in the [=storage classes/storage=]
storage class.

Host-shareable type |S| satisfies <dfn noexport>uniform buffer layout</dfn> when |S| satisfies
[=standard buffer layout rules=] for storage class [=storage classes/storage=].

Host-shareable type |S| satisfies <dfn noexport>storage buffer layout</dfn> when |S| satisfies
[=standard buffer layout rules=] for storage class [=storage classes/storage=].

### Abstract Operations on Pointers TODO ### {#abstract-pointer-operations}

A pointer value *P* supports the following operations:

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>P.Write(V)<td>Place a value V into the referenced storage.
               V’s type must match P’s pointee type.
  <tr><td>P.Read()<td>An evaluation yielding the value currently in the P’s
             referenced storage.  The result type is P's pointee type.
  <tr><td>P.Subaccess(K)<td>Valid for pointers with a composite pointee type where
                   *K* must evaluate to an integer between 0 and one
                   less than the number of components in *P*’s pointee type.
                   The subaccess evaluation yields a pointer to the storage for
                   the K’th component within P’s referenced storage,
                   using zero-based indexing. If P's [=storage class=] is SC, and
                   the K'th member of P's pointee type is of type T, then
                   the result type is `ptr<SC,T>`.
</table>

Note: Assignment of swizzled values is not permitted (SubaccessSwizzle).<br>
           e.g. `vec4<i32> v; v.xz = vec2<i32>(0, 1);` is not allowed.

### Pointer Evaluation TODO ### {#pointer-evaluation}

TODO: *This is a stub*: Using pointers in context. Disambiguating which abstract operation occurs based on context:
pointer semantics vs. dereferenced value semantics.

A pointer may appear in exactly the following contexts

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>Indexing<td>
A subaccessing evaluation
* E.g. `a[12]`
    * If `a` is a pointer to an array, this evaluates to *a.Subaccess(12)*

* E.g. `s.foo`
    * If `s` is a pointer to a structure of type *S*, `k` is the index of the `foo` element of *S*, this evaluates to *s.Subaccess(k)*

  <tr><td>Assigning (L-Value)<td>
On the left hand side of an assignment operation, and the right hand side
matches the pointee type of the pointer.

  <tr><td>Copying<td>
On the right hand side of a const-declaration, and the type of the
const-declaration matches the pointer type.
* E.g. `const v2 : ptr<private,i32> = v;`  assuming prior declaration
        `var<private> v:i32`

  <tr><td>Parameter<td>
Used in a function call, where the function’s parameter type matches the
pointer type.

type.

## Texture and Sampler Types ## {#texture-types}

A <dfn noexport>texel</dfn> is a scalar or vector used as the smallest independently accessible element of a [=texture=].
The word *texel* is short for *texture element*.

A <dfn noexport>texture</dfn> is a collection of texels supporting special operations useful for rendering.
In [SHORTNAME], those operations are invoked via texture builtin functions.
See [[#texture-builtin-functions]] for a complete list.

A [SHORTNAME] texture corresponds to a [[WebGPU#gputexture|WebGPU GPUTexture]].

A texture is either arrayed, or non-arrayed:

* A <dfn noexport>non-arrayed texture</dfn> is a grid of texels. Each texel has a unique grid coordinate.
* An <dfn noexport>arrayed texture</dfn> is a homegeneous array of grids of texels.
    In an arrayed texture, each texel is identified with its unique combination of array index and grid coordinate.

A texture has the following features:

: texel format
:: The data in each texel. See [[#texel-formats]]
:  dimensionality
:: The number of dimensions in the grid coordinates, and how the coordinates are interpreted.
    The number of dimensions is 1, 2, or 3.
    In some cases the third coordinate is decomposed so as to specify a cube face and a layer index.
: size
:: The extent of grid coordinates along each dimension
: mipmap levels
:: The mipmap level count is at least 1 for sampled textures, and equal to 1 for storage textures.<br>
    Mip level 0 contains a full size version of the texture.
    Each successive mip level contains a filtered version of the previous mip level
    at half the size (within rounding) of the previous mip level.<br>
    When sampling a texture, an explicit or implicitly-computed level-of-detail is used
    to select the mip levels from which to read texel data.  These are then combined via
    filtering to produce the sampled value.
: arrayed
:: whether the texture is arrayed
: <dfn noexport>array size</dfn>
:: the number of homogeneous grids, if the texture is arrayed

A texture's representation is typically optimized for rendering operations.
To achieve this, many details are hidden from the programmer, including data layouts, data types, and
internal operations that cannot be expressed directly in the shader language.

As a consequence, a shader does not have direct access to the texel storage within a texture variable.
Instead, use texture builtin functions as follows:

* Within the shader:
    * Declare a module-scope variable in the [=storage classes/handle=] storage class,
        where the [=store type=] is one of the texture types described in later sections.
    * Inside a function, call one of the texture builtin functions, and provide
        the texture variable as the first parameter.
* When constructing the WebGPU pipeline, the texture variable's store type and binding
    must be compatible with the corresponding bind group layout entry.

In this way, the set of supported operations for a texture type
is determined by the availability of texture builtin functions accepting that texture type
as the first parameter.

### Texel formats ### {#texel-formats}

In [SHORTNAME], certain texture types are parameterized by texel format.

A <dfn noexport>texel format</dfn> is characterized by:

: <dfn noexport>channels</dfn>
:: Each channel contains a scalar.
    A texel format has up to four channels: `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a`,
    normally corresponding to the concepts of red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
: <dfn noexport>channel format</dfn>
:: The number of bits in the channel, and how those bits are interpreted.

Each texel format in [SHORTNAME] corresponds to a [[WebGPU#enumdef-gputextureformat|WebGPU GPUTextureFormat]]
with the same name.

Only certain texel formats are used in [SHORTNAME] source code.
The channel formats used to define those texel formats are listed in the
<dfn dfn>Channel Formats</dfn> table.
The last column specfies the conversion from the stored channel bits to the value used in the shader.
This is also known as the <dfn noexport>channel transfer function</dfn>, or CTF.

correspond to the [[WebGPU#plain-color-formats|WebGPU plain color formats]]
which support the [[WebGPU#dom-gputextureusage-storage|WebGPU STORAGE]] usage.
These texel formats are used to parameterize the storage texture types defined
in [[#texture-ro]] and [[#texture-wo]].

When the texel format does not have all four channels, then:

* When reading the texel:
    * If the texel format has no green channel, then the second component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no blue channel, then the third component of the shader value is 0.
    * If the texel format has no alpha channel, then the fourth component of the shader value is 1.
* When writing the texel, shader value components for missing channels are ignored.

The last column in the table below uses the format-specific
[=channel transfer function=] from the [=channel formats=] table.

### Sampled Texture Types ### {#sampled-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>

`texture_cube<type>`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %type Cube 0 0 0 1 Unknown

`texture_cube_array<type>`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %type Cube 0 1 0 1 Unknown
</pre>
* type must be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`
* The parameterized type for the images is the type after conversion from sampling.
    E.g. you can have an image with texels with 8bit unorm components, but when you sample
    them you get a 32-bit float result (or vec-of-f32).

### Multisampled Texture Types ### {#multisampled-texture-type}

<pre class='def'>
`texture_multisampled_2d<type>`
  %1 = OpTypeImage %type 2D 0 0 1 1 Unknown
</pre>
* type must be `f32`, `i32` or `u32`

### Read-only Storage Texture Types ### {#texture-ro}

A <dfn noexport>read-only storage texture</dfn> supports reading a single texel without the use of a sampler,
with automatic conversion of the stored texel value to a usable shader value.
See [[#texture-builtin-functions]].

A read-only storage texture type must be parameterized one of [=storage-texel-format|texel formats for storage textures=].
The texel format determines the conversion function as specified in [[#texel-formats]].

TODO(dneto): Move description of the conversion to the builtin function that actually does the reading.

<pre class='def'>
`texture_storage_ro_1d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 1D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_ro_1d_array<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 1D 0 1 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_ro_2d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 2D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_ro_2d_array<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 2D 0 1 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_ro_3d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage sampled_type 3D 0 0 0 2 texel_format
</pre>

In the SPIR-V mapping:
* The *Image Format* parameter of the image type declaration is
    as specified by the SPIR-V texel format correspondence table in [[#texel-formats]].
* The *Sampled Type* parameter of the image type declaration is
    the SPIR-V scalar type corresponding to the channel format for the texel format.

When mapping to SPIR-V, a read-only storage texture variable must also have a `NonWritable` decoration.
For example:

<div class='example' heading='Mapping a texture_storage_ro_1d variable to SPIR-V'>
  <xmp>
      var tbuf : texture_storage_ro_1d<rgba8unorm>;

      # Maps to the following SPIR-V:
      #  OpDecorate %tbuf NonWritable
      #  ...
      #  %float = OpTypeFloat 32
      #  %image_type = OpTypeImage %float 1D 0 0 0 2 Rgba8
      #  %image_ptr_type = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %image_type
      #  %tbuf = OpVariable %image_ptr_type UniformConstant
  </xmp>
</div>

### Write-only Storage Texture Types ### {#texture-wo}

A <dfn noexport>write-only storage texture</dfn> supports writing a single texel, with automatic conversion
of the shader value to a stored texel value.
See [[#texture-builtin-functions]].

A write-only storage texture type must be parameterized one of [=storage-texel-format|texel formats for storage textures=].
The texel format determines the conversion function as specified in [[#texel-formats]].
The *inverse* of the conversion function is used to convert the shader value to
the stored texel.

TODO(dneto): Move description of the conversion to the builtin function that actually does the writing.

<pre class='def'>
`texture_storage_wo_1d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage %void 1D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_wo_1d_array<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage %void 1D 0 1 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_wo_2d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage %void 2D 0 0 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_wo_2d_array<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage %void 2D 0 1 0 2 image_format

`texture_storage_wo_3d<texel_format>`
  # %1 = OpTypeImage %void 3D 0 0 0 2 image_format
</pre>

In the SPIR-V mapping:
* The *Image Format* parameter of the image type declaration is
    as specified by the SPIR-V texel format correspondence table in [[#texel-formats]].
* The *Sampled Type* parameter of the image type declaration is
    the SPIR-V void type

When mapping to SPIR-V, a write-only storage texture variable must also have a `NonReadable` decoration.
For example:

<div class='example' heading='Mapping a texture_storage_wo_1d variable to SPIR-V'>
  <xmp>
      var tbuf : texture_storage_wo_1d<rgba8unorm>;

      # Maps to the following SPIR-V:
      #  OpDecorate %tbuf NonReadable
      #  ...
      #  %float = OpTypeFloat 32
      #  %image_type = OpTypeImage %float 1D 0 0 0 2 Rgba8
      #  %image_ptr_type = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %image_type
      #  %tbuf = OpVariable %image_ptr_type UniformConstant
  </xmp>

# Variable and const # {#variables}

TODO: *Stub* (describe what a constant is): A constant is a name for a value, declared via a `const` declaration.
What types are permitted?  Storable, plus pointer to store type.

TODO(dneto): A const may not be of type pointer-to-handle. A function parameter may not have type pointer-to-handle.
Otherwise we'd have a need to make a pointer-to-handle type expression. But we've reserved the [=storage classes/handle=] keyword.
When translating from SPIR-V, you must trace through
the OpCopyObject (or no-index OpAccessChain) instructions that might be between
the pointer-to-array and the pointer-to-struct.

A <dfn dfn noexport>variable</dfn> is a named reference to storage that can contain a value of a
particular storable type.

Two types are associated with a variable: its <dfn noexport>store type</dfn> (the type of value
that may be placed in the referenced storage) and its <dfn noexport>reference type</dfn> (the type
of the variable itself).  If a variable has store type *T* and [=storage class=] *S*,
then its reference type is pointer-to-*T*-in-*S*.

A <dfn dfn noexport>variable declaration</dfn>:

* Determines the variable’s name, storage class, and store type (and hence its reference type).
* Ensures the execution environment allocates storage for a value of the store type, for the lifetime of the variable.
* Optionally have an *initializer* expression, if the variable is in the [=storage classes/private=], [=storage classes/function=], or [=storage classes/out=] storage classes.
    If present, the initializer's type must match the store type of the variable.

See [[#module-scope-variables]] and [[#function-scope-variables]] for rules about where
a variable in a particular storage class can be declared,
and when the storage class decoration is required, optional, or forbidden.

The access decoration must only appear on a type used as the store type for a
variable in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.
The access decoration must not appear
on a type of const declaration nor as the store type for variable with a
storage class other than [=storage classes/storage=]. The access decoration is required for
variables in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.

Two variables with overlapping lifetimes will not have overlapping storage.

When a variable is created, its storage contains an initial value as follows:

* For variables in the [=storage classes/private=], [=storage classes/function=], or [=storage classes/out=] storage classes:
    * The zero value for the store type, if the variable declaration has no initializer.
    * Otherwise, it is the result of evaluating the initializer expression at that point in the program execution.
* For variables in other storage classes, the execution environment provides the initial value.

<div class='example' header='Variable initial values'>
  Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var i: i32;         # Initial value is 0.  Not recommended style.
    loop {
      var twice: i32 = 2 * i;   # Re-evaluated each iteration.
      i = i + 1;
      break if (i == 5);
    }
  </xmp>
  The loop body will execute five times.
  Variable `i` will take on values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and variable `twice` will take on values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
</div>

<div class='example'>
  Consider the following snippet of WGSL:
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var x : f32 = 1.0;
    const y = x * x + x + 1;
  </xmp>
  Because `x` is a variable, all accesses to it turn into load and store operations.
  If this snippet was compiled to SPIR-V, it would be represented as
  <xmp highlight='asm'>
    %temp_1 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_2 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_3 = OpFMul %float %temp_1 %temp_2
    %temp_4 = OpLoad %float %x
    %temp_5 = OpFAdd %float %temp_3 %temp_4
    %y      = OpFAdd %float %temp_5 %one
  </xmp>
  However, it is expected that either the browser or the driver optimizes this intermediate representation
  such that the redundant loads are eliminated.
</div>

## Module Scope Variables ## {#module-scope-variables}

A variable or constant declared outside a function is at <dfn noexport>module scope</dfn>.
The name is available for use immediately after its declaration statement, until the end
of the program.

Variables at module scope are restricted as follows:

* The variable must not be in the [=storage classes/function=] storage class.
* A variable in the [=storage classes/in=], [=storage classes/out=], [=storage classes/private=], `workgroup`, [=storage classes/uniform=], or [=storage classes/storage=] storage classes:
    * Must be declared with an explicit storage class decoration.
    * Must use a [=store type=] as described in [[#storage-class]].
* If the [=store type=] is a texture type or a sampler type, then the variable declaration must not
    have a storage class decoration.  The storage class will always be [=storage classes/handle=].

Variables in the [=storage classes/in=] and [=storage classes/out=] storage classes are pipeline inputs and outputs. See [[#pipeline-inputs-outputs]].

A variable in the [=storage classes/uniform=] storage class is a <dfn noexport>uniform buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] structure type with [=block=] attribute,
satisfying the [=uniform buffer layout=] rules.

A variable in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class is a <dfn noexport>storage buffer</dfn> variable.
Its [=store type=] must be a [=host-shareable=] structure type with [=block=] attribute,
satisfying the [=storage buffer layout=] rules.

As described in [[#resource-interface]],
uniform buffers, storage buffers, textures, and samplers form the
[=resource interface of a shader=].
Such variables are declared with [=group=] and [=binding=] decorations.

## Module Constants ## {#module-constants}

A *module constant* declares a name for a value, outside of all function declarations.
The name is available for use after the end of the declaration,
until the end of the [SHORTNAME] program.

When the declaration has no attributes, an initializer expression must be present,
and the name denotes the value of that expression.

<div class='example' heading='Module constants'>
  <xmp>
    const golden : f32 = 1.61803398875;       # The golden ratio
    const e2 : vec3<i32> = vec3<i32>(0,1,0);  # The second unit vector for three dimensions.
  </xmp>
</div>

When the declaration uses the `constant_id` attribute,
the constant is *pipeline-overridable*. In this case:

  * The type must one of the [=scalar=] types.
  * The initializer expression is optional.
  * The attribute's literal operand is known as the *pipeline constant ID*,
    and must be a non-negative integer value representable in 32 bits.
  * Pipeline constant IDs must be unique within the [SHORTNAME] program: Two module constants
    must not use the same pipeline constant ID.
  * The application can specify its own value for the name at pipeline-creation time.
    The pipeline creation API accepts a mapping from the pipeline constant ID
    to a value of the constant's type.
    If the mapping has an entry for the ID, the value in the mapping is used.
    Otherwise, the initializer expression must be present, and its value is used.

Issue(dneto): What happens if the application supplies a constant ID that is not in the program?
Proposal: pipeline creation fails with an error.

<div class='example' heading='Module constants, pipeline-overrideable'>
  <xmp>
    [[constant_id(0)]]    const has_point_light : bool = true;      # Algorithmic control
    [[constant_id(1200)]] const specular_param : f32 = 2.3;         # Numeric control
    [[constant_id(1300)]] const gain : f32;                         # Must be overridden
  </xmp>
</div>

When a variable or feature is used within control flow that depends on the
value of a constant, then that variable or feature is considered to be used by the
program.
This is true regardless of the value of the constant, whether that value
is the one from the constant's declaration or from a pipeline override.

</div>

Issue(dneto): The WebGPU pipeline creation API must specify how API-supplied values are mapped to
shader scalar values.  For booleans, I suggest using a 32-bit integer, where only 0 maps to `false`.
If [SHORTNAME] gains non-32-bit numeric scalars, I recommend overridable constants continue being 32-bit
numeric types.

## Function Scope Variables and Constants ## {#function-scope-variables}

A variable or constant declared in a declaration statement in a function body is in <dfn noexport>function scope</dfn>.
The name is available for use immediately after its declaration statement,
and until the end of the brace-delimited list of statements immediately enclosing the declaration.

A variable declared in function scope is always in the [=storage classes/function=] storage class.
The variable storage decoration is optional.
The variable's [=store type=] must be [=storable=].

<div class='example' heading="Function scope variables and constants">
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    fn f() -> void {
       var<function> count : u32;  # A variable in function storage class.
       var delta : i32;            # Another variable in the function storage class.
       var sum : f32 = 0.0;        # A function storage class variable with initializer.
       const unit : i32 = 1;       # A constant. Const declarations don't use a storage class.
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

A variable or constant declared in the first clause of a `for` statement is available for use in the second
and third clauses and in the body of the `for` statement.

## Zero Value Expressions ## {#zero-value-expr}

Each storable type *T* has a unique *zero value*, written in WGSL as the type followed by an empty pair of parentheses: *T* `()`.

Issue: We should exclude being able to write the zero value for an [=runtime-sized=] array. https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/981

The zero values are as follows:

* `bool()` is `false`
* `i32()` is 0
* `u32()` is 0
* `f32()` is 0.0
* The zero value for an *N*-element vector of type *T* is the *N*-element vector of the zero value for *T*.
* The zero value for an *N*-column *M*-row matrix of `f32` is the matrix of those dimensions filled with 0.0 entries.
* The zero value for an *N*-element array with storable element type *E* is an array of *N* elements of the zero value for *E*.
* The zero value for a storable structure type *S* is the structure value *S* with zero-valued members.

## Composite Value Expressions TODO ## {#composite-value-expr}

### Vector Access Expression ### {#vector-access-expr}

Accessing members of a vector can be done either using array subscripting (e.g. `a[2]`) or using a sequence of convenience names, each mapping to an element of the source vector.

<ul>
  <li>The colour set of convenience names: `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` for vector elements 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
  <li>The dimensional set of convenience names: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` for vector elements 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
</ul>

The convenience names are accessed using the `.` notation. (e.g. `color.bgra`).

NOTE: the convenience letterings can not be mixed. (i.e. you can not use `rybw`).

Using a convenience letter, or array subscript, which accesses an element past the end of the vector is an error.

The convenience letterings can be applied in any order, including duplicating letters as needed. You can provide 1 to 4 letters when extracting components from a vector. Providing more then 4 letters is an error.

The result type depends on the number of letters provided. Assuming a `vec4<f32>`

case_selectors
  : const_literal (COMMA const_literal)*

case_body
  :
  | statement case_body
  | FALLTHROUGH SEMICOLON
</pre>

A switch statement transfers control to one of a set of case clauses, or to the `default` clause,
depending on the evaluation of a selector expression.

The selector expression must be of a scalar integer type.
If the selector value equals a value in a case selector list, then control is transferred to
the body of that case clause.
If the selector value does not equal any of the case selector values, then control is
transferred to the `default` clause.

Each switch statement must have exactly one default clause.

The case selector values must have the same type as the selector expression.

A literal value must not appear more than once in the case selectors for a switch statement.

Note: The value of the literal is what matters, not the spelling.
For example `0`, `00`, and `0x0000` all denote the zero value.

When control reaches the end of a case body, control normally transfers to the first statement
after the switch statement.
Alternately, executing a `fallthrough` statement transfers control to the body of the next case clause or
default clause, whichever appears next in the switch body.
A `fallthrough` statement must not appear as the last statement in the last clause of a switch.


### Loop Statement ### {#loop-statement}

<pre class='def'>
loop_statement
  : LOOP BRACE_LEFT statements continuing_statement? BRACE_RIGHT
</pre>

The loop construct causes a block of statements, the *loop body*, to execute repeatedly.

This repetition can be interrupted by a [[#break-statement]], `return`, or
`discard`.

Optionally, the last statement in the loop body may be a
[[#continuing-statement]].

Note: The loop statement is one of the biggest differences from other shader
languages.

This design directly expresses loop idioms commonly found in compiled code.
In particular, placing the loop update statements at the end of the loop body
allows them to naturally use values defined in the loop body.

<div class='example' heading='GLSL Loop'>
  <xmp>
    int a = 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      a *= 2;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Loop">
  <xmp>
    const a : i32 = 2;
    var i : i32 = 0;      // <1>
    loop {
      if (i >= 4) { break; }

      a = a * 2;

      i = i + 1;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
* <1> The initialization is listed before the loop.

<div class='example' heading='GLSL Loop with continue'>
  <xmp>
    int a = 2;
    const int step = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i += step) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
      a *= 2;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Loop with continue">
  <xmp>
    const a : i32 = 2;
    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      if (i >= 4) { break; }

      const step : i32 = 1;

      i = i + 1;
      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; }

      a = a * 2;
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Loop with continue and continuing">
  <xmp>
    const a : i32 = 2;
    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      if (i >= 4) { break; }

      const step : i32 = 1;

      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; }

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {   // <2>
        i = i + step;
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
* <2> The continue construct is placed at the end of the `loop`

### For Statement ### {#for-statement}

<pre class='def'>
for_statement
  : FOR PAREN_LEFT for_header PAREN_RIGHT body_statement

for_header
  : (variable_statement | assignment_statement | func_call_statement)? SEMICOLON
     short_circuit_or_expression? SEMICOLON
     (assignment_statement | func_call_statement)?
</pre>

The `for(initializer; condition; continuing) { body }` statement is syntactic sugar on top of a [[#loop-statement]] with the same `body`. Additionally:
* If `initializer` is non-empty, it is executed inside an additional scope before the first iteration.
* If `condition` is non-empty, it is checked at the beginning of the loop body and if unsatisfied then a [[#break-statement]] is executed.
* If `continuing` is non-empty, it becomes a [[#continuing-statement]] at the end of the loop body.

<div class='example' heading="For to Loop transformation">
  <xmp>
    for(var i : i32 = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) {
      if (a == 0) {
        continue;
      }
      a = a + 2;
    }

    Converts to:

    { # Introduce new scope for loop variable i
      var i : i32 = 0;
      loop {
        if (!(i < 4)) {
          break;
        }

        if (a == 0) {
          continue;
        }
        a = a + 2;

        continuing {
          i = i + 1;
        }
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>


### Break ### {#break-statement}

<pre class='def'>
break_statement
  : BREAK
</pre>

Use a `break` statement to transfer control to the first statement
after the body of the nearest-enclosing [[#loop-statement]]
or [[#switch-statement]].

When a `break` statement is placed such that it would exit from a loop's [[#continuing-statement]],
then:

* The `break` statement must appear as either:
    * The only statement in the true-branch clause of an `if` that has:
        * no `else` clause or an empty `else` clause
        * no `elseif` clauses
    * The only statement in the `else` clause of an `if` that has an empty true-branch clause and no `elseif` clauses.
* That `if` statement must appear last in the `continuing` clause.

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Valid loop if-break from a continuing clause">
  <xmp>
    const a : i32 = 2;
    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      const step : i32 = 1;

      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; }

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
        if (i >= 4) { break; }
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Valid loop if-else-break from a continuing clause">

    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      const step : i32 = 1;

      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; }

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
        if (i < 4) {} else { break; }
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

<div class='example' heading="[SHORTNAME] Invalid breaks from a continuing clause">
  <xmp>
    const a : i32 = 2;
    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      const step : i32 = 1;

      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; }

      a = a * 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
        break;                                     // Invalid: too early
        if (i < 4) { i = i + 1; } else { break; }  // Invalid: if is too complex, and too early
        if (i >= 4) { break; } else { i = i + 1; } // Invalid: if is too complex
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>

### Continue ### {#continue-statement}

<pre class='def'>
continue_statement
  : CONTINUE
</pre>

Use a `continue` statement to transfer control in the nearest-enclosing [[#loop-statement]]:

*  forward to the [[#continuing-statement]] at the end of the body of that loop, if it exists.
*  otherwise backward to the first statement in the loop body, starting the next iteration

A `continue` statement must not be placed such that it would transfer
control to an enclosing [[#continuing-statement]].
(It is a *forward* branch when branching to a `continuing` statement.)

A `continue` statement must not be placed such that it would transfer
control past a declaration used in the targeted continuing construct.

<div class='example' heading="Invalid continue bypasses declaration">
  <xmp>
    var i : i32 = 0;
    loop {
      if (i >= 4) { break; }
      if (i % 2 == 0) { continue; } // <3>

      const step : i32 = 2;

      continuing {
        i = i + step;
      }
    }
  </xmp>
</div>
* <3> The `continue` is invalid because it bypasses the declaration of `step` used in the `continuing` construct

### Continuing Statement ### {#continuing-statement}

<pre class='def'>
continuing_statement
  : CONTINUING body_statement
</pre>

A *continuing* construct is a block of statements to be executed at the end of a loop iteration.
The construct is optional.

The block of statements must not contain a return or discard statement.

### Return ### {#return-statement}

<pre class='def'>
return_statement
  : RETURN short_circuit_or_expression?
</pre>

A `return` statement ends execution of the current function.
If the function is an entry point, then the current shader invocation
is terminated.
Otherwise, evaluation continues with the next expression or statement after
the evaluation of the call site of the current function invocation.

If the return type of the function is the void type, then the return statement is
optional. If the return statement is provided for a void function it must not have an expression.
Otherwise the expression must be present, and is called the *return value*.
In this case the call site of this function invocation evaluates to the return value.
The type of the return value must match the return type of the function.


### Discard TODO ### {#discard-statement}

The `discard` statement must only be used in a [=fragment=] shader stage.

A function declaration may only occur at module scope.
The function name is available for use after its declaration, until the end of the program.

If the return type of the function is not the void type, then the last statement
in the function body must be a return statement.

Function names must be unique over all functions and all variables in the

## Shader Stages ## {#shader-stages-sec}

In WebGPU, a <dfn noexport>pipeline</dfn> is a unit of work executed on the GPU.
There are two kinds of pipelines: GPUComputePipeline, and GPURenderPipeline.

A <dfn noexport>GPUComputePipeline</dfn> runs a
<dfn noexport>compute shader stage</dfn> over a logical
grid of points with a controllable amount of parallelism,
while reading and possibly updating buffer and image resources.

A <dfn noexport>GPURenderPipeline</dfn> is a multi-stage process with
two programmable stages among other fixed-function stages:

* A <dfn noexport>vertex shader stage</dfn> maps input attributes for a single vertex into
    output attributes for the vertex.
* Fixed-function stages map vertices into graphic primitives (such as triangles)
    which are then rasterized to produce fragments.
* A <dfn noexport>fragment shader stage</dfn> processes each fragment,
    possibly producing a fragment output.
* Fixed-function stages consume a fragment output, possibly updating external state
    such as color attachments and depth and stencil buffers.

The WebGPU specification describes pipelines in greater detail.

[SHORTNAME] defines three <dfn noexport>shader stages</dfn>, corresponding to the
programmable parts of pipelines:

* <dfn noexport>compute</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>vertex</dfn>
* <dfn noexport>fragment</dfn>

Each shader stage has its own set of features and constraints, described elsewhere.

## Entry point declaration ## {#entry-point-decl}

An <dfn noexport>entry point</dfn> is a function that is invoked to perform
the work for a particular [=shader stage=].

Specify a `stage` attribute on a function declaration to declare that function
as an entry point.

When configuring the stage in the pipeline, the entry point is specified by providing
the [SHORTNAME] module and the entry point's function name.

An entry point function must have no parameters,
and its return type must be [=void=].

<div class='example' heading='Entry Point'>
  <xmp>
    [[stage(vertex)]]
    fn vtx_main() -> void { gl_Position = vec4<f32>(); }
       # OpEntryPoint Vertex %vtx_main "vtx_main" %gl_Position

    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn frag_main -> void { gl_FragColor = vec4<f32>(); }
       # OpEntryPoint Fragment %frag_main "frag_main" %gl_FragColor

    [[stage(compute)]]
    fn main() -> void { }
       # OpEntryPoint GLCompute %main "main"
  </xmp>
</div>

The set of <dfn noexport>functions in a shader stage</dfn> is the union of:

* The entry point function for the stage.
* The targets of function calls from within the body of a function
    in the shader stage, whether or not that call is executed.

The union is applied repeatedly until it stabilizes.
It will stabilize in a finite number of steps.

: <dfn noexport>stage</dfn>
:: The `stage` attribute declares that a function is an entry point for particular pipeline stage.
: <dfn noexport>workgroup_size</dfn>
:: The `workgroup_size` attribute specifies the x, y, and z dimensions of the [=workgroup grid=]
    for a [=compute=] shader.
    The size in the x dimension is provided by the first literal.
    The size in the y dimension is provided by the second literal, when present, and otherwise
    is assumed to be 1.
    The size in the z dimension is provided by the third literal, when present, and otherwise
    is assumed to be 1.
    Each dimension size must be at least 1 and at most an upper bound specified by the WebGPU API.
    This attribute must only be used with a [=compute shader stage=] entry point.

ISSUE: Can we query upper bounds on workgroup size dimensions?  Is it independent of the shader, or
  a property to be queried after creating the shader module?

<div class='example' heading='workgroup_size Attribute'>
  <xmp>
    [[ stage(compute), workgroup_size(8,1,1) ]]
    fn sorter() -> void { }
       # OpEntryPoint GLCompute %sorter "sorter"

    [[ stage(compute), workgroup_size(8) ]]
    fn reverser() -> void { }
       # OpEntryPoint GLCompute %reverser "reverser"
       # OpExecutionMode %reverser LocalSize 8 1 1

</div>

## Shader Interface ## {#shader-interface}

The shader interface is the set of objects
through which the shader accesses data external to the [=shader stage=],
either for reading or writing.
The interface includes:

* Pipeline inputs and outputs
* Buffer resources
* Texture resources

These objects are represented by module-scope variables in certain [=storage classes=].

We say a variable is <dfn noexport>statically accessed</dfn> by a function if any subexpression
in the body of the function uses the variable's identifier,
and that subexpression is [=in scope=] of the variable's declaration.
Note that being statically accessed is independent of whether an execution of the shader
will actually evaluate the subexpression, or even execute the enclosing statement.

More precisely, the <dfn noexport>interface of a shader stage</dfn>
is the set of module-scope variables
[=statically accessed=] by [=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=],
and which are in storage classes [=storage classes/in=], [=storage classes/out=], [=storage classes/uniform=], [=storage classes/storage=], or [=storage classes/handle=].

### Pipeline Input and Output Interface ### {#pipeline-inputs-outputs}

A <dfn noexport>pipeline input</dfn> is data provided to the shader stage from upstream in the pipeline.
A pipeline input is denoted by a module-scope variable in the [=storage classes/in=] storage class.
The store type must be [=IO-shareable=].

A <dfn noexport>pipeline output</dfn> is data the shader provides for further processing downstream in the pipeline.
A pipeline output is denoted by a module-scope variable in the [=storage classes/out=] storage class.
The store type must be [=IO-shareable=].

Each pipeline input or output is one of:

* A built-in variable. See [[#builtin-inputs-outputs]].
* A user data attribute. See [[#user-data-attributes]].

#### Built-in inputs and outputs #### {#builtin-inputs-outputs}

A <dfn noexport>built-in input variable</dfn> provides access to system-generated control information.
The set of built-in inputs are listed in [[#builtin-variables]].

To declare a variable for accessing a particular input built-in *X*:

* Declare a module-scope variable in the [=storage classes/in=] storage class,
    where the [=store type=] is the listed store type for *X*.
* Apply a `builtin(`*X*`)` attribute to the variable.
* The variable must not have an initializer. The system provides the value.

A <dfn noexport>built-in output variable</dfn> is used by the shader to convey
control information to later processing steps in the pipeline.
The set of built-in outputs are listed in [[#builtin-variables]].

To declare a variable for accessing a particular output built-in *Y*:

* Declare a module-scope variable in the [=storage classes/out=] storage class,
    where the [=store type=] is the listed store type for *Y*.
* Apply a `builtin(`*Y*`)` attribute to the variable.
* The variable may have an initializer, or not, as described in [[#variables]].

<div class='example' heading="Declaring built-in variables">
  <xmp>
    # vertex shader output builtin
    [[builtin(position)]] var<out> my_position : vec4<f32>;

    # fragment shader input builtin
    [[builtin(frag_coord)]] var<in> coord : vec4<f32>;

    # compute shader builtin
    [[builtin(global_invocation_id)]] var<in> global_id : vec3<u32>;
  </xmp>
</div>

The `builtin` attribute must not be applied to a variable in a storage class other than [=storage classes/in=] or [=storage classes/out=].

An input built-in must only be applied to a variable in the [=storage classes/in=] storage class.

An output built-in must only be applied to a variable in the [=storage classes/out=] storage class.

A variable must not have more than one `builtin` attribute.

Each built-in variable has an associated shader stage, as described in [[#builtin-variables]].
If a built-in variable has stage *S* and is [=statically accessed=] by a function *F*,
then *F* must be a [=functions in a shader stage|function in a shader=]
for stage *S*.


Issue:
    1. The statement makes it clear that in/out storage classes for builtins are redundant.
    2. On the other hand, in Vulkan, builtin variables occoupy I/O location slots (counting toward limits),

#### User Data Attribute TODO #### {#user-data-attributes}

#### Input-output Locations TODO #### {#input-output-locations}
TODO: *Stub*. Location-sizing of types, non-overlap among variables referenced within an entry point static call tree.

### Resource interface ### {#resource-interface}

A <dfn noexport>resource</dfn> is an object,
other than a [[#pipeline-inputs-outputs|pipeline input or output]],
which provides access to data external to a [=shader stage=].
Resources are shared by all invocations of the shader.

There are four kinds of resources:

* [=uniform buffers=]
* [=storage buffers=]
* textures
* samplers

The <dfn noexport>resource interface of a shader</dfn> is the set of module-scope
resource variables [=statically accessed=] by
[=functions in a shader stage|functions in the shader stage=].

Each resource variable must be declared with both <dfn noexport>`group`</dfn>
and <dfn noexport>`binding`</dfn> attributes.
Together with the shader's stage, these identify the binding address
of the resource on the shader's pipeline.
See [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout|WebGPU &sect; GPUPipelineLayout]].

Bindings must not alias within a shader stage:
two different variables in the resource interface of a given
shader must not have the same group and binding values, when considered as a pair of values.

      <td>Bind group index
  <tr><td>`binding`
      <td>non-negative i32 literal

</table>

### Resource layout compatibility ### {#resource-layout-compatibility}

WebGPU requires that a shader's resource interface match the [[WebGPU#pipeline-layout|layout of the pipeline]]
using the shader.

Each [SHORTNAME] variable in a resource interface must be bound to a WebGPU resource with
a compatible
[[WebGPU#enumdef-gpubindingtype|GPUBindingType]],
where compatibility is defined by the following table.

TODO: Rewrite the phrases 'read-only storage buffer' and 'read-write storage buffer' after
we settle on how to express those concepts.
See https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1183

If |B| is a [=uniform buffer=] variable in a resource interface,
and |WB| is the [[WebGPU#buffer-interface|WebGPU GPUBuffer]] bound to |B|, then:
* The size of |WB| must be at least as large
    as the [=allocation extent=] of the [=store type=] of |B| in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.

If |B| is a [=storage buffer=] variable in a resource interface,
and |WB| is the [[WebGPU#buffer-interface|WebGPU GPUBuffer]] bound to |B|, then:
* If the [=store type=] |S| of |B| does not contain a [=runtime-sized=] array, then
    the size of |WB| must be at least as large as the [=allocation extent=]
    of |S| in the [=storage classes/storage=] storage class.
* If the [=store type=] |S| of |B| contains a [=runtime-sized=] array as its last member,
    then:
    * The runtime-determined array length of that member must be at least 1.
    * The size of |WB| must be at least as large as the [=allocation extent=] in
        storage class [=storage classes/storage=] of the value stored in |B|.

Note: Recall that a [=runtime-sized=] array may only appear as the last element in the structure
type that is the store type of a storage buffer variable.

## Compute Shaders and Workgroups ## {#compute-shader-workgroups}

A <dfn noexport for="compute shader stage">workgroup</dfn> is a set of invocations which
concurrently execute a [=compute shader stage=] [=entry point=],
and share access to shader variables in the [=storage classes/workgroup=] storage class.

The <dfn noexport>workgroup grid</dfn> for a compute shader is the set of points
with integer coordinates *(i,j,k)* with:

*  0 &leq; i &lt; workgroup_size_x
*  0 &leq; j &lt; workgroup_size_y
*  0 &leq; k &lt; workgroup_size_z

where *(workgroup_size_x, workgroup_size_y, workgroup_size_z)* is
the value specified for the [=workgroup_size=] attribute of the
entry point, or (1,1,1) if the entry point has no such attribute.

There is exactly one invocation in a workgroup for each point in the workgroup grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>local invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding workgroup grid point.

When an invocation has [=local invocation ID=] (i,j,k), then its
<dfn noexport>local invocation index</dfn> is

  i +
  (j * workgroup_size_x) +
  (k * workgroup_size_x * workgroup_size_y)

<p algorithm="local index range">Note that if a workgroup has |W| invocations,
then each invocation |I| the workgroup has a unique local invocation index |L|(|I|)
such that 0 &le; |L|(|I|) &lt; |W|,
and that entire range is covered.</p>

A compute shader begins execution when a WebGPU implementation
removes a dispatch command from a queue and begins the specified work on the GPU.
The dispatch command specifies a <dfn noexport>dispatch size</dfn>,
which is an integer triple *(group_count_x, group_count_y, group_count_z)*
indicating the number of workgroups to be executed, as described in the following.

The <dfn noexport>compute shader grid</dfn> for a particular dispatch
is the set of points with integer coordinates *(CSi,CSj,CSk)* with:

*  0 &leq; CSi &le; workgroup_size_x &times; group_count_x
*  0 &leq; CSj &le; workgroup_size_y &times; group_count_y
*  0 &leq; CSk &le; workgroup_size_z &times; group_count_z

where *workgroup_size_x*,
*workgroup_size_y*, and
*workgroup_size_z* are as above for the compute shader entry point.

The work to be performed by a compute shader dispatch is to execute exactly one
invocation of the entry point for each point in the compute shader grid.

An invocation's <dfn noexport>global invocation ID</dfn> is the coordinate
triple for the invocation's corresponding compute shader grid point.

The invocations are organized into workgroups, so that each invocation
*(CSi, CSj, CSk)* is identified with the workgroup grid point

   ( *CSi* mod workgroup_size_x ,
     *CSj* mod workgroup_size_y ,
     *CSk* mod workgroup_size_z )

in workgroup instance

   ( &lfloor; *CSi* &div; workgroup_size_x &rfloor;,
     &lfloor; *CSj* &div; workgroup_size_y &rfloor;,
     &lfloor; *CSk* &div; workgroup_size_z &rfloor;).

WebGPU provides no guarantees about:

* Whether invocations from different workgroups execute concurrently.
    That is, you cannot assume more than one workgroup executes at a time.
* Whether, once invocations from a workgroup begin executing, that other workgroups
    are blocked from execution.
    That is, you cannot assume that only one workgroup executes at a time.
    While a workgroup is executing, the implementation may choose to
    concurrently execute other workgroups as well, or other queued but unblocked work.
* Whether invocations from one particular workgroup begin executing before
    the invocations of another workgroup.
    That is, you cannot assume that workgroups are launched in a particular order.

Issue: [WebGPU issue 1045](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/1045):
Dispatch group counts must be positive.
However, how do we handle an indirect dispatch that specifies a group count of zero.

### Floating point conversion ### {#floating-point-conversion}

When converting a floating point scalar value to an integral type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
* If the original value has a fractional component, then it cannot be represented exactly in the destination type, and the result is TODO
* If the original value is out of range of the destination type, then TODO.

When converting a value to a floating point type:
* If the original value is exactly representable in the destination type, then the result is that value.
    * If the original value is zero and of integral type, then the resulting value has a zero sign bit.
* Otherwise, the original value is not exactly representable.
    * If the original value is different from but lies between two adjacent values representable in the destination type,
         then the result is one of those two values.
         [SHORTNAME] does not specify whether the larger or smaller representable
         value is chosen, and different instances of such a conversion may choose differently.
    * Otherwise, if the original value lies outside the range of the destination type.
         * This does not occur when the original types is one of [=i32=] or [=u32=] and the destination type is [=f32=].
         * This does not occur when the source type is a floating point type with fewer exponent and mantissa bits.
         * If the source type is a floating point type with more mantissa bits than the destination type, then:
             * The extra mantissa bits of the source value may be discarded (treated as if they are 0).
                 * If the resulting value is the maximum normal value of the destination type, then that is the result.
             * Otherwise the result is the infinity value with the same sign as the source value.
    * Otherwise, if the original value is a NaN for the source type, then the result is a NaN in the destination type.

NOTE: An integer value may lie between two adjacent representable floating point values.
In particular, the [=f32=] type uses 23 explicit fractional bits.
Additionally, when the floating point value is in the normal range (the exponent is neither extreme value), then the mantissa is
the set of fractional bits together with an extra 1-bit at the most significant position at bit position 23.
Then, for example, integers 2<sup>28</sup> and 1+2<sup>28</sup> both map to the same floating point value: the difference in the
least significant 1 bit is not representable by the floating point format.
This kind of collision occurs for pairs of adjacent integers with a magnitude of at least 2<sup>25</sup>.

Issue: (dneto) Default rounding mode is an implementation choice.  Is that what we want?

Issue: Check behaviour of the f32 to f16 conversion for numbers just beyond the max normal f16 values.
I've written what an NVIDIA GPU does.  See https://github.com/google/amber/pull/918 for an executable test case.

# Built-in functions # {#builtin-functions}

Certain functions are always available in a [SHORTNAME] program,
and are provided by the implementation.
These are called *built-in functions*.

Since a built-in function is always in scope, it is an error to attempt to redefine
one or to use the name of a built-in function as an identifier for any other
kind of declaration.

Unlike ordinary functions defined in a [SHORTNAME] program,
a built-in function may use the same function name with different
sets of parameters.
In other words, a built-in function may have more than one *overload*,
but ordinary function definitions in [SHORTNAME] may not.

When calling a built-in function, all arguments to the function are evaluated
before function evaulation begins.

TODO(dneto): Elaborate the descriptions of the built-in functions.  So far I've only reorganized
the contents of the existing table.

<table class='data'>
  <tr><td>`t`<td>
  The [sampled](#sampled-texture-type) or [depth](#texture-depth) texture to
  sample.

  dimensions. Values outside of this range will be clamped to the nearest limit.
</table>

**Returns:**

The sampled value.


### `textureSampleCompare` ### {#texturesamplecompare}

textureSampleCompare(t : texture_depth_2d, s : sampler_comparison, coords : vec2<f32>, depth_ref : f32) -> f32
textureSampleCompare(t : texture_depth_2d, s : sampler_comparison, coords : vec2<f32>, depth_ref : f32, offset : vec2<i32>) -> f32

  before sampling the texture. This offset is applied before applying any
  texture wrapping modes. `offset` values may range from `[-8..7]` in all
  dimensions. Values outside of this range will be clamped to the nearest limit.
</table>

**Returns:**

A value in the range `[0.0..1.0]`.

Each sampled texel is compared against the reference value using the comparision
operator defined by the `sampler_comparison`, resulting in either a `0` or `1`
value for each texel.

If the `sampler_comparison` uses bilinear filtering then the returned value is
the filtered average of these values, otherwise the comparision result of a
single texel is returned.

## Composite types ## {#composite-types}

A type is *composite* if its values have a well-defined internal
structure of typed *components*.

The following types are *composite types*:

* [[#vector-types]]
* [[#matrix-types]]
* [[#array-types]]
* [[#struct-types]]

[SHORTNAME] has operations for:

* extracting one of the components of a composite value
* creating a new composite value from an old one by replacing one of its components
* creating a new composite value from components

## Type Promotions ## {#type-promotions}
There are no implicit type promotions in [SHORTNAME]. If you want to convert between
types you must use the cast syntax to do it.

<div class='example'>
  <xmp highlight='rust'>
    var e : f32 = 3;    # error: literal is the wrong type

    var f : f32 = 1.0;

    var t : i32 = i32(f);
  </xmp>
</div>

The non-promotion extends to vector classes as well. There are no overrides to
shorten vector declarations based on the type or number of elements provided.
If you want `vec4<f32>` you must provide 4 float values in the constructor.

## Precedence ## {#precedence}

Issue: (dsinclair) Write out precedence rules. Matches c and glsl rules ....
