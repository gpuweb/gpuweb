Type name: text

Subtype name: wgsl

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

  WGSL is Unicode text using the UTF-8 encoding, with no byte order mark (BOM).
  See [WGSL] Section 3. Textual Structure.

Security considerations:

  WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) is a programming language for GPU
  code to be executed in the context of the WebGPU API. For security
  considerations, see [WebGPU] Section 2.1 Security Considerations.

Interoperability considerations:
 
  Implementations of WebGPU may have different capabilities, and
  these differences may affect what features may be exercised by
  WGSL programs. See [WebGPU] Section 3.6 Optional capabilities,
  and [WGSL] Section 11. Language Extensions.

  It is expected that implementations will behave as if this
  registration applies to later editions of [WGSL], and its published
  specification references may be updated accordingly from time to
  time.  Although this expectation is unusual among media type
  registrations, it matches widespread industry conventions.

Published specification: [WGSL]

Applications that use this media type:

  Implementations of WebGPU [WebGPU]. This is expected to include
  web browsers.

Fragment identifier considerations: None

  Magic number(s): None
  File extension(s): .wgsl
