name: Publish static files to GitHub Pages

# Workflow runs on pushes to the main branch. It publishes statics files to
# GitHub Pages. The specs themselves (WebGPU, WGSL, the explainer) are handled
# separately in a different workflow.
# The "workflow_dispatch" hook allows admins to trigger the workflow manually
# from GitHub's UI.
