# This workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to the main branch, and
# builds/validates the specs, other documents, and supplemental materials.
# This includes verifying the WGSL grammar which is one of the generated
# supplemental materials.
#
# On pushes to the main branch, it also publishes the outputs to GitHub Pages.

  # Note, spec-prod can publish to gh-pages as well, but we use a custom publish
  # step to publish additional files anyway, so we use that instead of making
  # many separate gh-pages commits (one per bikeshed file + one for extras).
