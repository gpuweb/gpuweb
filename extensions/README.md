# WebGPU Extensions

Extensions defined in this directory are drafts and are **not part of the WebGPU specification**. Compliant implementations of WebGPU **must not** expose these extensions.

Feature additions on the "standards track" may be initially proposed as extensions if they
are not easily contained in a GitHub pull request.

For the intended "roadmap" of a given extension, check the note at the top of its document.
