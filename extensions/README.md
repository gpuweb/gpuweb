# WebGPU Extensions

Extensions defined in this directory are drafts and are **not standardized**. Compliant implementations of WebGPU **must not** expose these extensions by default.

Proposed feature additions should be proposed as part of the main WebGPU/WGSL specifications, rather than as extensions.
