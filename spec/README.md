# WebGPU Specification

## Generating the specification

The specification is written using [Bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed).

If you have bikeshed installed locally, you can generate the specification with:

```
prompt> make
```

This simply runs bikeshed on the `index.bs` file.

Otherwise, you can use the bikeshed Web API:

```
prompt> make online
```
